<!-- \textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The SSC supports the recommended OFL calculation approach as specified in the current assessment. For future consideration, the SSC recommends returning to calculation of a single OFL and ABC for the combined model results (as in 2017)}" -->

<!-- \textbf{Response}:   -->
<!-- \makebox[165 mm]{\dotfill} -->


<!-- \textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The SSC recommends continued exploration into either a single-area or a two-area spatially explicit model, noting that a two-area spatially explicit model may serve as a bridge between previous separate model approaches and a combined model approach.}" -->

<!-- \textbf{Response}:  A combined, stock-wide model was not prioritized during this cycle. -->
<!-- \makebox[165 mm]{\dotfill} -->


<!-- \textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The authors and CPT should provide a table reporting the historical OFL buffers used in this stock to inform future discussions on the incorporation of uncertainty (see General BSAI Crab Comments)}" -->

<!-- \textbf{Response}:   -->
<!-- \makebox[165 mm]{\dotfill} -->


<!-- \textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The author and CPT should explore metrics to determine if changes in CPUE are due to changes in fishing behavior (e.g. changes in number of strings or number of pots per boat) as was suggested during public testimony}" -->

<!-- \textbf{Response}:  See Appendix C of this document. -->
<!-- \makebox[165 mm]{\dotfill} -->


<!-- \textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The author should explore mechanisms for examining the impact on CPUE from within crab fleet gear conflicts or fishing behavior as well as conflicts between crab fleet gear and the gear of the trawl fleet. The current bycatch data in the trawl fisheries may not be sufficient for this, but perhaps could be augmented with data on changes in effort or catch distribution changes}" -->

<!-- \textbf{Response}:  See Appendix C of this document. -->
<!-- \makebox[165 mm]{\dotfill} -->


<!-- \textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The author is encouraged to work with ESR authors on developing risk recommendations related to environmental changes. The SSC notes there have been long term environmental changes taking place in the Western Aleutian region}" -->

<!-- \textbf{Comment}: "\textit{A spatio-temporal model is encouraged. However, the inclusion of the interaction term between soak time and year may alias changes in relative abundance. Some rationale should be given as to including that interaction or this element should be eliminated}" -->

<!-- \textbf{Response}:  The CPUE standardization in Appendix A does not consider a soak time:year interaction, but does provide rationale for it. The purpose in estimating the effect of soak time by year is to capture a more meaningful effect of soak time, as the functional form of that relationship changes as vessel dynamics in the fishery change. It is possible that soak time is as much a reflection of fishery dynamics, as it is of relative abundance. -->

<!-- \textbf{Response}: See plots below. The CPT recommend using 1987 - 2020 during the May 2024 assessment, and adding a year sequentially after that.

<!-- \textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Document why the 1993 bycatch and total catch size-composition data are not included in this and past assessments.}" -->

<!-- \textbf{Response}: Issues with 1993 observer data (not bycatch) have been resolved by model 23.1 (data). There was no observer coverage in the 1993 crab year for EAG directed fishing and for WAG, most pots were previously removed because they were of unknown size. Those pots are now included for size composition data only, which also affects total catch estimation.   -->

<!-- \textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Explore the reasons for the implausible values for groundfish fishing mortality in some years for some of the retrospectives and some of the jitter runs.}" -->

<!-- \textbf{Response}: This was presented at the May 2024 plan team meeting. The model estimated a large recruitment pulse preceding 1996, which appeared to allow for better fit to 1996 observer index data. Because size composition data in the directed fishery and the base natural mortality rate could not support such a recruitment pulse, the model 'killed off' the extra crab in the bycatch fishery which does not have associated composition data and large CV. Running the model with a .pin file that specifies appropriate starting values for $F$ deviations or increasing the penalty on $F$ deviations in that fleet resolves the issue.   -->

# Model Explorations {-}

Poor fit to the index data in the EAG and the associated retrospective pattern in MMB continues to be the primary issue with the AIGKC assessment. Model explorations during the 2025 assessment cycle focused largely on data weighting, specifically as it relates to size composition and catch data. Alternative input sample sizes and using a Dirichlet multinomial likelihood function did little to resolve apparent data conflict, and an updated version of the 2024 accepted model (23.1c) was used to determine management specifications for 2025/26. Recent CPT recommendations suggest exploring time varying selectivity as a means to address model misspecification. Here, I examine changes in fleet dynamics over time in relation to current assumptions about selectivity and catchability in the directed fishery. In addition, I revisted non-equilibrium initial conditions, a spatiotemporal GLMM approach for CPUE standardization, size at maturity, and a combined EAG / WAG model. Models evaluated in this document include (See Figure \ref{fig:models} for flow chart):

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{23.1c}: base model, accepted for specifications in May 2025;

\item \textbf{25.0a}: Model 23.1c, non-equilibrium initial conditions starting in 1981 and equal emphasis factors on all likelihood components;

\item \textbf{26.0}: Model 23.1c, with spatiotemporal standardized CPUE index, catchability time-blocks 1995 - 2004 and 2005 - 2024;

\item \textbf{26.0a}: Model 26.0, non-equilibrium initial conditions starting in 1981 and equal emphasis factors on all likelihood components;

\item \textbf{26.1}: Model 26.0a, with additional subdistrict-specific time blocks on directed fishery selectivity;

\item \textbf{26.1a}: Model 26.0a, with a random walk on directed fishery selectivity from 2005 - 2024;

\item \textbf{26.1b}: Model 26.0a, with additional subdistrict-specific time blocks on directed fishery catchability;

\item \textbf{26.1c}: Model 26.0a, with additional subdistrict-specific time blocks on directed fishery selectivity and catchability.

\end{itemize}

## Updates to Base Model {-}

The 2025 final assessment was conducted using GMACS version 2.20.21. This document uses the updated version 2.20.31. A log of changes made between versions can be found at the bottom of the ADMB 2.20.31 template file (\href{https://github.com/GMACS-project/GMACS_tpl-cpp_code/blob/devel-20250402/gmacsbase.TPL}{\underline{gmacsbase.tpl}}). None of the changes affect features used by the current AIGKC assessment. There are no differences in likelihood components or reference points for model 23.1c (Table \ref{table:versionlik} and \ref{table:versionref}).

## Size at Maturity {-}

Appendix B details an updated analysis on size at maturity. The analysis includes updated data from the at-sea observer program and ADF$\&$G special collections. This analysis also explores differences between estimation methods used by Olson et al. (2018) and Siddeek (2022), as well as likelihood profiles and bootstrap distributions of estimated size at maturity by data source. Since size at maturity is only used for computing harvest specifications and does not influence model performance, no alternative models with varying size at maturity are presented here. The CPT should consider whether it is worth bringing forward harvest specification options with updated size at maturity for the 2026 final assessment, or if the status quo (116 mm CL) should remain until a more refined estimate is available.

## Intitial conditions and catch emphasis {-}

Previous assessment models started in 1960 assuming the population was in an unfished state, with no fishing mortality until 1981 (Jackson 2025). Model 25.0a starts in a non-equilibrium state in 1981 and initial numbers at size were estimated from parameters representing initial recruitment (R$_{init}$) and scaled deviates for each size class. The size bin at which crab first become legally retained, 136 - 140 mm CL, was used as the reference size class. This model previously considered in September 2025, but was not brought forward for the 2025 final assessment. In addition to starting in non-equilibrium conditions, model 25.0a uses equal likelihood emphasis ($\lambda$ = 1) for all catch data series. 

## Spatiotemporal GLMM CPUE index {-}

Appendix A details estimation of an abundance index based on CPUE standardization using a spatiotemporal GLMM in the R package $sdmTMB$ (Anderson et al. 2024). The 'best' model estimated legal male CPUE as a function of gear type (i.e., pot size) and smooth effects of soak time and depth. Vessel was included as a random effect and spatiotemporal random effects were IID. Aside from model parameterization, this approach differs from previous assessments in that does not split CPUE standardization into pre- (1995 - 2004) and post-rationalization (2005 - present) periods. Rather, standardized CPUE is input to GMACS as a single index with time varying selectivity and catchability (detailed below). All 26.x models use the standardized CPUE index estimated in Appendix A.

## Time varying selectivity and catchability {-}

Models 26.0 and 26.0a assumed time blocks for selectivity and catchability corresponding to changes in fishing operations before and after crab rationalization (i.e., 2005). These models differed in initial conditions and emphasis on catch data as described above. In May 2025 the CPT recommended revisiting selectivity time blocks in response to unresolved poor fits to EAG index data. Process error associated with selectivity and catchability here are likely related to changing fleet dynamics (CITATIONS). It is important to clarify that "selectivity" in this context refers to the combination of animal availability to fishing grounds and selectivity by the gear. During the pre-rationalized era there was a greater number and diversity of fishing vessels with more competitive, overlapping fishing grounds and less selective fishing behavior. Crab rationalization resulted in a drastic downsizing of the fleet in both subdistricts initially, and since then there has been further consolidation of vessels and vessel-specific fishing grounds (Figure \ref{fig:obspotheat} - \ref{fig:modeveswag}). These changes in fleet dynamics are clearly evidenced by observer data, but unaccounted for in the post-rationalized era. 

Models in the 26.1 series explored time blocks in the post-rationalization specific to vessel composition of observer data in the EAG and WAG (since CPUE index is computed using observer data). Note that instances exist where vessels may have fulfilled observer coverage requirements in the broader AIGKC fishery, but may not be represented in the observer data at the subdistrict level (e.g., only one trip was made to the EAG and during an unobserved leg of the season). These circumstances were rare and likely not influential. Additional EAG time blocks included the the early post-rationalization fleet consolidation from 2005 - 2007, a period from 2018 - 2013 after further consolidation, a period from 2014 - 2021 corresponding to the swap of the \textit{F/V Aleutian No. 1} and \textit{F/V Patricia Lee}, and from 2022 to present after the departure of those vessels. WAG time blocks include 2005 - 2015 when the fishery was dominated by three vessels, 2016 - 2020 when the \textit{F/V Early Dawn} was present and the \textit{F/V Patricia Lee} was not, and from 2021 to present when most observed data were collected aboard the \textit{F/V Alaska Trojan} and \textit{F/V Aleutian No. 1} (Figure \ref{fig:obspotheat}).

Model 26.1 used the proposed block structure for selectivity, while maintaining a single post-rationalization block for catchability. Model 26.1a was the same as model 26.1, but estimated selectivity as a random walk since crab rationalization. Model 26.1b used the proposed block structure for catchability, while maintaining a single post-rationalization block for selectivity, and model 26.1c used the proposed post-rationalization time blocks for selectivity and catchability. 

## Combined model {-}

Progress toward a combined subdistrict model for AIGKC has been a repeating recommendation by the SSC and was last presented to the CPT in January 2024. Currently, the GMACS framework does not directly accommodate multiple spatial domains. The previous approach integrated subdistricts as different directed fleets with a combined bycatch fleet based on model 23.1b (Jackson 2024 - MODEL EXPLORE DOC). A drawback of this approach is that it does not allow for area specific recruitment deviations, which are evident in the recruitment estimates of each subdistrict. The CPT recommended treating the subdistricts as different sexes as a potential work around allowing some model processes to be shared, while allowing greater flexibility in others.  

Here, the 'base' combined subdistrict model was most closely based on model 25.0a and used the EAG as the reference sex class. The model started in non-equilibrium conditions in 1981 with initial numbers at size estimated using 136 - 140 mm CL in the EAG as the reference class. Recruitment sex ratio deviations were estimated for all years and recruitment size distributions differed between subdistricts. Weight at length, size at maturity, natural mortality were shared. Subdistrict specific models estimate growth using the same tagging data which was collected in the EAG with releases in 1991, 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006 (Siddeek et al. 2016). The GMACS framework does not allow growth functions to be mirrored between sexes and tagging data cannot be specified as belonging to both sexes. As a stop-gap, the data were simply duplicated so molt probability and growth transition matrices could be estimated separately for either subdistrict. Directed catch, index, and size composition data were input as the same fleet, but different series by subdistrict. Bycatch data were combined because GMACS would not allow different discard moralities by sex for the same year (i.e., discard mortalities are different for EAG and WAG due to differing proportions of trawl and fixed gear bycatch). Selectivities, rentention, and catchability were estimated separately for each subdistrict. The timing of the fishery was recomputed for each year using EAG and WAG start and end dates combined. One small alteration made to GMACS 2.20.31 was to bypass the SPR sex ratio feature during reference point calculation to allow for full contribution of EAG and WAG MMB.

In addition to the model described above (AI 25.0a), model AI 26.1 used directed fishery selectivity time blocks as in EAG/WAG 26.1 and AI 26.1a modeled selectivity in the post-rationalization era as a random walk.

## Retrospective Analysis and Jittering {-}

Retrospective analysis was not performed for 26.x models due to technical difficulties associated with time blocks for catchability. These issues will be resolved before the final assessment in May. Previous analyses have demonstrated that strong retrospective patterns in the EAG likely arise from model mispecification that also leads to poor fits to CPUE index data. Thereby, models presented here that better fit index data will presumably also have improved retrospective patterns. Jittering was performed for a subset of author recommended models using a jitter factor of 0.3 and 500 iterations as in the 2025 final assessment (Jackson 2025). 

# Model Comparisons {-}

## Intial conditions and catch emphasis {-}

Equal emphasis on catch data series had little impact on fits to data, as expected (Figure \ref{fig:eagcatchfit} and \ref{fig:wagcatchfit}). Small differences in scale of recruitment in the 1990's and since 2019 lead to slight differences in MMB in EAG. There is some difference in recruitment during the 1990's in the WAG, but recent trends are more similar (Figure \ref{fig:recinit} and \ref{fig:mmbinit}). It is unclear why initial conditions lead to different recruitment scales in recent years, but note that this pattern was also present in model 25.0, which weighted catch data similar to model 23.1c (Jackson 2024). Nevertheless, starting the model in 1981 is preferred as it slightly reduces the number of estimable parameters and eliminates the issue of relative high equilibrium MMB and recruitment before the data time series.

## Spatiotemporal GLM CPUE index {-}

Standardized observer CPUE index derived from a spatiotemporal model that included all years from 1995 - present resulted in a marginally different index trajectory in each rationalization period (Appendix A). Likewise, inputting a single index with catchability time blocks corresponding to crab rationalization had little impact on fits to index data and derived quantities (Figure \ref{fig:recinit} - \ref{fig:mmbinit}). Model 23.1c should remain as the 'base' model for 2026 final assessment for posterity, but from a practical standpoint, the author would expect to favor model 26.0 or 26.0a as a 'base' alternative.

## Time varying selectivity and catchability {-}

Models 26.1 - 26.1c explore variability in the fishing process in relation to vessel dynamics. All scenarios that added selectivity blocks during post-rationalization improved fit to CPUE data and reduced observation error in the EAG (Table \ref{table:addcv}, Figure \ref{fig:eagindexfit}). As anticipated, model 26.1a was the most flexible and fit index data best. Models with catchability blocks fit marginally better than model 26.1 (Figure \ref{fig:eagindexfit}). Model 26.1 suggests that selectivity in the EAG was lower in the first half of the rationalized era (2005 - 2013), increased after the introduction of the $F/V$ Patricia Lee (2015), and became steeper when the fleet consolidated to two vessels in 2022. Selectivity in model 26.1a followed a similar pattern, though with more interannual variability, especially during the period from 2008 - 2013 (Figure \ref{fig:postratslx}). Catchability in the EAG increased with each additional time block, while selectivity of model 26.1b was similar to model 26.0, and model 26.1c was less variable (Figure \ref{fig:qslx} and \ref{fig:postratslx}). WAG models fit index data more similarly, and model 26.1a appeared to over fit data. Selectivity time blocks were less variable that in the EAG, and there was less apparent directionality in the selectivity random walk in model 26.0a (Figure \ref{fig:postratslx}). Catchability estimates increased with successive time blocks, as in the EAG, except for model 26.1c during the 2021 - 2024 time block (Figure \ref{fig:qslx}).  

Fits to size composition data were nearly identical among all 26.x models, despite selectivity differences in the EAG (Figure \ref{fig:sizecomp}). All models in both subdistricts underestimate total size composition proportions of 101 - 105 mm CL crab and the first two legal size classes (136 - 145 mm CL) (Figure \ref{fig:sizecomp} - \ref{fig:osawag26.0a}). Residual patterns in total size composition data may be in part due to misfits to first year tag returns, which underestimate average molt increment in most sizes less than 140 mm CL (Figure \ref{fig:eagtag} and \ref{figwagtag}). All models fit tagging data similarly, which was expected given all tag returns were specified as having been during one year of the pre-rationalization selectivity period. Siddeek et al. (2016) lists tag releases in 1991, 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006. It is possible that timing of tag releases was dropped for simplicity during the transition to GMACS. It is worth revisiting original growth data and growth parameterization to address residual patterns in identified here. In addition, tag releases were planned for the WAG during the 2025/26 season, which hopefully generate new area-specific growth data in coming years.

Models estimated similar recruitment trajcetories in the EAG until $\sim$ 2015. Model 26.0a was most similar to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:recinit}). Models with selectivity time blocks did not estimate a dip in recruitment in 2022 and 2023, in fact, model 26.1c suggested recruitment continually increased from 2020 to 2023. Model 26.1b estimated a more drastic decline in recruitment from 2015 to 2022 than other models, and a strong increase during the previous two years (Figure \ref{fig:recslx}). Recruitment estimates in the WAG were similar among models, expect for model 26.1a, which estimated an peak in recruitment from 2020 - 2022 as opposed to the decrease estimated by other models (Figure \ref{fig:recslx}).  

MMB estimates in the EAG differed in scale throughout the 2000s, but followed a similar trend. Since 2010, MMB trajectories differ based on whether multiple post-rationalization time blocks were included. Models 26.1, 26.1a, and 26.1c all estimated peaks in MMB that corresponded to MMB peaks in the WAG, though models 26.1 and 26.1a estimated a stationary trend since $\sim$ 2014, whereas model 26.1c estimated a decreasing trend (Figure \ref{mmbslx}). WAG models had less variability in MMB estimates, with model 26.1a being the exception. Model 26.1a estimated a steeply increasing MMB trend since 2021, following a strong recruitment pulse in that year which corresponded to a spike in the proportion of immature-sized crab in the composition data. That recruitment pulse was not well represented in subsequent CPUE data and estimated selectivity for 2023 and 2024 was lower than previous years - that is, the increase in MMB was likely due to the highly flexible selectivity of model 26.1a.

Assigning process variability erroneously has been shown to have adverse consequences to management advice (Fisch et al., 2023; Szuwalksi et al., 2018). Specifically, risk is most associated with mischaracterization of which process is time varying. Others have demonstrated that there is less downside if process variability is modeled in the correct process, but over-parameterized (Cronin-Fine And Punt 2021; Stewart and Monnahan 2017). Index data used here is solely fishery dependent, and fishers are incentivized to optimize high CPUE with reduced sorting by varying soak times and fishing locations. Furthermore, fleet consolidation has likely increased the influence of the highest performing vessels and fishing behaviors, prompting concerns of hyperstability. Given the history of fleet consolidation and variation in fishing behavior, it is highly plausible that time varying selectivity and/or catchability is applicable to the post-rationalization era for AIGKC.  

All models that included post-rationalization process variation improved fit to EAG CPUE data, with little impact to fits to other data components. For the most part, it seems that when catchability and selectivity were allowed to vary together (model 26.1c), time varying catchability overpowered variability in selectivity. There appeared to be less consequence associated with choice of process in the WAG, though the random walk on selectivity was clearly over-paramaterized. In the EAG, the choice of how to structure selectivity variation was less clear, and there did
appear to be changes to derived quantities and reference points that warrant caution. Although a case could be made for allowing either process - or both - to vary, diagnostic analyses necessary for making a well informed recommendation were lacking here. For that reason, it may be worthwhile to bring several models forward for the final assessment assuming more in depth model diagnostics can be performed then. Model 23.1c should remain the base model and model 26.0a will bridge changes in initial conditions and CPUE standardization. Models 26.1 and 26.1b will evaluate time varying selectivity and catchability as a step function corresponding to fleet dynamics, respectively. A random walk on selectivity eliminated the subjective nature of time block designations, but is perhaps too flexible for use in harvest specifications in lieu of a more thorough investigation of process variation.


## Combined Model {-}

Combined models fit all data components similar to subdistrict-specific models, except observer CPUE (\ref{fig:aiindex1}). Poorer fit to CPUE data among combined models is likely the result of small changes in selectivity patterns for each subdistrict (Figure \ref{fig:aislxeag} and \ref{fig:aislxwag}). Recruitment trends mostly mirrored subdistrict-specific models, but diverged after $\sim$ 2016, where EAG recruitment decreased and WAG recruitment increased (Figure \ref{fig:airec}). Trends in MMB had a similar discrepancy from subdistrict-specific models (Figure \ref{fig:aimmb}). A more thorough investigation of combined model diagnostics is needed during the next development cycle, particularly with respect to data weighting among subdistricts. The analysis presented here demonstrates progress toward a combined model, but explored too many model scenarios to examine specific concerns in detail. A combined model should be evaluated again in 2026, considering only parameterizations based on 2026 accepted models for each subdistrict. Additional, the author requests more specific guidance from the CPT and SSC as to the priority of a combined model relative to recommendations concerning the subdistrict-specific models.


# Combined OFL Calculation {-}

Since the AIGKC is considered a single sock, though separate subdistrict models have been maintained to date, it is necessary to combine ic OFL calculations. In 2017 (when the tier 3 assessment was first adopted), the CPT and SSC considered two approaches (\href{https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=27175b87-79d8-43dd-ae8a-4d16284953b7.pdf\&fileName=C7\%20Crab\%20Plan\%20Team\%20Report\%20May\%202017.pdf}{\underline{May 2017 CPT Report}}):

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Apply the OFL control rule by area and sum the OFLs by area;}
\item{Determine stock status for the whole stock by adding the estimates of current MMB and B$_{\text{MSY}}$ by area. This stock status is then used to determine the ratio of F$_{\text{OFL}}$ to F$_{35\%}$ by area, which is then used to calculate the OFLs by area, which are then added together to calculate an OFL for the entire stock.}
\end{enumerate}

That is, to apply the F$_{\text{OFL}}$ control rule by subdistrict using a combined stock status ($B/B_{35\%}$) and ic F$_{35\%}$. The SSC and CPT recommendation in 2017 was to follow the second approach that used a combined stock status. The reasoning for the choice was that the first approach would result in subdistricts being in different tiers of the F$_{\text{OFL}}$ control rule (EAG Tier 3a, WAG Tier 3b). The 2018 final assessment reverted back to applying the F$_{\text{OFL}}$ control rule separately by subdistrict (Siddeek et al. 2018; \href{https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=f88cf4fb-1701-47da-81ae-e1f50c9bf5b5.pdf\&fileName=MOTION\%20C3.pdf}{\underline{C-3 Council Motion, June 2018}}), which is the approach that seems to have been used since. The SSC recommended returning to the 2017 F$_{\text{OFL}}$ calculation following the 2024 and 2025 final assessments. Table \ref{table:fofl} details F$_{\text{OFL}}$ from the 2025 final assessment using separate and combined stock status.

The choice of which approach to use seems to be a process oriented question. ADF$\&$G treats the EAG and WAG as distinct stocks to a practical extent when setting the total allowable catch (TAC). Exploitation rates on mature male abundance are subdistrict specific (EAG 15$\%$; WAG 20$\%$) in the state harvest strategy and distinct TACs are set for each subdistrict. Although TACs for this stock are based solely on assessment model outputs, federal catch limits (i.e., ABC/OFL) rarely limit TAC setting. ADF$\&$G generally has not considered risk of exceeding subdistrict specific reference points in TAC setting to date, though divergent population trends and increased conservation concern in the WAG likely warrants some consideration for the subdistrict specific management advice of the federal control rules. Under present conditions, combining stock status and recomputing F$_{\text{OFL}}$ would have the effect of applying surplus biomass in the EAG to harvest opportunity in the WAG. While a larger F$_{\text{OFL}}$ in the WAG may not necessarily equate to a larger TAC, the logic does not align with precautionary management of the subdistricts individually. In lieu of more comprehensive understanding of stock connectivity, it may be more prudent to remain with the status quo approach.
