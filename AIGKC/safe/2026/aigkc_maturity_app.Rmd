# Purpose {-}

May 2024 the CPT requested to revisit male size at maturity given the addition of new data. This document details progress in estimating area specific size at maturity using the full complement of available data to date.

# Background {-}

Chelae allometry has been used to determine size at morphometric maturity in various crab stocks. Specific to $Lithodes$ spp., male size at maturity has been determined as the point at which the slope of the linear relationship between chela height and carapace length (mm) increases (Jewett et al. 1985; Otto and Cummiskey 1985; Somerton and Otto 1986; Lovrich et al. 2002; Olson et al. 2018; Siddeek et al. 2022). Estimates of size at maturity in Alaska golden king crab stocks have varied across studies and by region.  

Otto and Cumminsky (1985) and Somerton and Otto (1986) used the break point analysis parameterized by Somerton and MacIntosh (1983) on log-transformed allometric data from male crab collected during a tagging study in the Northern EBS, Central EBS, Southern EBS, Bowers Ridge, and Seguam Pass. Estimated size at maturity ranged between 92 - 130 mm CL (Table \ref{table:bkgrnd}). Jewett et al. (1985) compared these estimates with and analysis of crab collected in British Columbia, where size at maturity was estimated to be 114 mm CL. Olson et al. (2018) evaluated various southeast Alaska golden king crab stocks and estimated size at maturity to range between 117.9 - 158 mm CL (Table \ref{table:bkgrnd}). Additionally, Olson et al. (2018) demonstrated that smaller size at maturity estimates corresponded with higher latitudes across previous studies, including those in Japan (Hiramoto 1985) and Russia (Zhivoglyadova 2004, Nizyaev 2005), though such a latitudinal cline was not evident in southeast AK.

Golden king crab male size at maturity was last assessed during the 2022 AIGKC stock assessment (Siddeek et al. 2022). Siddeek et al. (2022) compiled data collected by various means in both the EAG and WAG including samples from NMFS tagging studies (1984-85; EAG and WAG), ADF$\&$G pot surveys (1991-92; EAG), ADF$\&$G special collections during commercial fishery trips (2018/19 - 2020/21; WAG), at-sea observer deployments (2018/19 - 2019/20; EAG and WAG), and dockside sampling (2018/19 - 2020/21; EAG and WAG). Size data were not log-transformed in all samples, following Olson et al. (2018), and size at maturity was estimated using the R package $segmented$ (Muggeo et al., 2008). Instead of reporting point estimates, Siddeek et al. (2018) bootstrapped the analysis 1,000 times and estimated the mean, median, and associated uncertainty. Data were analyzed by collection effort and subdistrict (EAG/WAG). Bootstrap means ranged from 104.1 - 108.3 mm CL among EAG samples and 108.8 - 120.8 mm CL among WAG samples. When combined, size at maturity estimates ranged from 109 - 122.9 mm CL for the full stock (Table \ref{table:bkgrnd}). The CPT and SSC recommended adopting 116 mm CL based on the analysis of combined EAG/WAG data collected from at-sea observers and dockside sampling.

Here, I revisit the data analyzed by Siddeek et al. (2018) with the addition of new data, evaluate the influence of outliers, and examine spatial patterns in size at maturity, including data from the Pribilof Islands.

# Methods {-}

## Data {-}

Chela heights and carapce lengths were recorded during collection efforts described above (Siddeek et al. 2022). In addition, ADF$\&$G special collections during the 2017/18 WAG fishery were added, as were observer collections during the 2021/22 - 2023/24 fisheries (Table \ref{table:psiest}). Chela height data has also been recorded during dockside size frequency sampling, but were excluded here since they only include legal males, the vast majority of which are already mature.

## Estimation Algorithm {-}

Olson et al. (2018) estimated size as maturity using the R package $SiZer$ (Sonderegger 2011), which estimates the break point as 

\begin{equation}
CH = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}CL + \beta_{2}(x - \psi)^{+} + \epsilon 
\end{equation}

where $\psi$ is the break point (i.e. size at maturity), $\beta_{0}$ is the y-intercept, $\beta_{1}$ is the slope when CL < $\psi$, $\beta_{2}$ is the slope when CL > $\psi$, and $(x - \psi)^{+}$ is an indicator function which goes to zero when CL < $\psi$. The optimal break point, $\hat{\psi}$ is estimated via grid search with preliminary estimates of $\beta$ parameters, which are refined once $\hat{\psi}$ is assumed known. Confidence intervals are estimated by bootstrapping. Siddeek et al. (2022) estimated size at maturity using the R package $segmented$ (Muggeo 2008). Muggeo (2008) used the same functional form, but estimated the model using a Newton-Raphson optimization in which an initial value of $\psi$ is iteratively updated until convergence. The breakpoint, $\psi$, is re-parameterized as $\gamma$ which measures the difference between the current value of $\psi$ ($\tilde{\psi}$) and the optimized value ($\hat{\psi}$) such that $\tilde{\psi}$ is updated as $\hat{\psi} = \tilde{\psi} + \hat{\gamma}/\hat{\beta_{2}}$. The standard error of $\hat{\psi}$ is approximated using the Delta method (Muggeo 2008).  

Optimization methods were compared by simulating data sets with varying uncertainty and computing estimates of $\psi$ using each approach. Simulated carapace lengths were drawn from a uniform distribution from 50 - 190 mm. Linear coefficients ($\beta_{i}$) and mean size at maturity ($\bar{\psi}$) were based on the full observed data set. Individual variation in $\bar{\psi}$ was added as $\mathcal{N}(0, \psi_{\sigma^2})$, in which $\psi_{\sigma}$ was either 1, 3, or 6. Residual error was simulated as $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \epsilon_{\sigma}^2)$ where $\epsilon_{\sigma}$ ranged from 1 to 6 (residual standard error for the full data set was approximately 3.2). Size at maturity was estimated using both Muggeo (2008) and Sonderegger (2011) methods.

## AIGKC Size at Maturity {-}

Size at maturity (i.e., the break point, $\psi$) was first estimated separately by data source and subdistrict. Data were then aggregated and size at maturity was estimated by subdistrict. Estimation used the method by Muggeo et al. (2008), with bootstrap restarting of the initial value of $\psi$ up to 100 iterations. The likelihood profile of $\psi$ was computed over a range of plausible values to determine if the algorithm converged to the minimum. Following Siddeek et al. (2022), the distribution of $\psi$ was evaluated by non-parametric bootstrap resampling at 1,000 iterations. Bootstrap distributions of $\psi$ were generated for estimates by data source and subdistrict, and by subdistrict only.

# Results {-}

The proportion of simulations that converged to the same value of $\psi$ ranged from 0.76 - 0.99, with the highest proprtions being when data were noisiest ($\epsilon_{\sigma}$ = 6) (Table \ref{table:simrestab}). Individual variation in $\psi$ had less influence on the performance of either method (Figure \ref{fig:simres}). When optimization method did converge to different values, differences tended to be greater as residual error increased, as did the precision of $\psi$ estimates (Figure \ref{fig:simres}).

Variability in chela height at size was least among NMFS collected samples and slightly greater among ADF$\&$G collect samples. Observer data were most variable and included many potentially erroneous or regenerated claw measurements (i.e., abnormally small chela heights for larger carapace lengths) (Figure \ref{fig:sourcesubfit}). Breakpoint estimates ranged from 117.2 mm CL to 126.5 mm CL among EAG data sources and from 119.7 mm CL to 124.1 mm CL among WAG data soucres (Table \ref{table:psiest}; Figure \ref{fig:sourcesubfit}). Likelihood profiles of $\psi$ corroborated estimates were at the approximate optimum for $\psi$ among all data sources except EAG observer samples and WAG ADF$\&$G samples. Likelihood profile optimum breakpoints were $\psi$ = 125 mm CL and $\psi$ = 121.5 mm CL, respectively. Bootstrap distributions of $\psi$ were very noisy with multiple modes (Figure \ref{fig:sourcesubboot}). When aggregated by subdistrict, estimated size at maturity was 124.5 mm CL in the EAG and 121.6 mm CL in the WAG (Table \ref{table:psiest}; Figure \ref{fig:subfit}). Likelihood profiles suggested estimates were at the optimum values for $\psi$. Bootstrap distributions were unimodal, though for the WAG the majority of bootstrap samples produced a larger value of $\psi$ than the point estimate (Figure \ref{fig:subboot}).

# Discussion {-}

Based on the limited simulation experiment conducted here, estimation methods perform similarly with chela height and carapce length data in golden king crab. The method by Muggeo (2008) is preferred since standard errors can be approximated using the Delta method.  

Estimated size at maturity ($\psi$) appears to be sensitive to variability in the ratio of chela height to carapce length, as evidenced by differing point estimates and multimodal bootstrap distributions. Data collected by NMFS in 1984 were the most precise, followed by the more recent ADF$\&$G special collections taken in the WAG. The disaprity in the precision of the data is likely due to measurement error, as recent data collected by ADF$\&$G in the Pribilof Islands aligns with the precision of NMFS and ADF$\&$G measurements in the Aleutians. Observer data are the most ubiquitous data available, but should be considered with caution. Estimatation of size at maturity using aggregated data appeared to be considerably more stable, possibly owing to the much larger sample size. Point estimates suggested that size at maturity were similar in the EAG and WAG, though slightly larger in the EAG. Interestingly the bootstrap distribution of $\psi$ in the WAG centered on a value larger than the WAG point estimate and the mode of the EAG bootstrap distribution. Siddeek et al (2022) estimated size at maturity in the WAG to be larger than in the EAG, but with a greater disprity ($\sim$ 12 mm). 

Size at morphometric maturity of Aleutian Islands golden king crab based on chela morphology is likely somewhere between $\sim$ 110 - 130 mm CL, though variable by study and data included (Otto and Cumminsky 1985; Somerton and Otto 1986; Siddeek et al. 2022). Additional data collections by ADF$\&$G are being undertaken in the EAG during the 2025/26 fishery, so estimates presented here will be further refined before the 2026 final assessment. It is important to note that a the link between chela morphology and physiological or functional maturity in $Lithodes$ crabs is not well understood. While there does appear to be a shift in allometry at a certain size, it remains unclear whether this change in chela morphology influences mating dynamics as it does in other species. Paul and Paul (2001) evaluated functional maturity of Prince William Sound golden king crab in a non-competitive laboratory setting. The smallest male that they observed to successfully fertilize a female was 101 mm CL, but they concluded that functional maturity was $\geq$ 110 mm CL with several males successfully mating with larger females. This analysis will be refined and brought forward again in May 2026 to determine whether subdsitrict-specific size at maturity estimates should be used in this assessment.
