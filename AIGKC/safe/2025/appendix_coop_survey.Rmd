# Background {-}

The AIGKC cooperative pot survey was initiated in 2015 in the EAG and has continued every year since with the exception of 2020. The survey was extended to the WAG in 2018. The main purpose of the survey is to generate a cost effective data stream available to the stock assessment that is spatially representative and less susceptible to hyperstability than fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). The survey has occurred during the beginning of each season, with participating vessels setting pots strings at pre-determined stations and later hauling strings with ADF\&G staff on board for collection of biological data. Survey data is available for 2015-2023 in the EAG and 2018 and 2019 in the WAG. Since only two years of data are available for the WAG, this appendix only details the preparation of assessment model inputs for the EAG. 

# Methods {-}

## Station Selection and Sampling {-}

The survey area in the EAG consists of a 2x2 nmi grid overlaying the full range of historically fished areas. The survey grid is divided into strata to improve spatial representation. Strata have varied over the time series depending on the vessels participating, but since 2022 the survey design has included three strata (Figure \ref{fig:areamap}). Vessels divided sampling efforts based on their respective fishing grounds. Survey data pre-2022 were stratified to the current design $post$ $hoc$.  

Grid cells were randomly selected among strata, and selections were removed or reallocated as necessary to avoid gear conflicts with groundfish trawl operations. The number of selected cells has varied by year. Since 2022 the initial selection process in the EAG included 25 grid cells per stratum. Vessels set pot strings on longlines intersecting grid cells at their digression and there are no specific requirements on string length or soak time (Figure \ref{fig:stringmap}). Biologists systematically sampled 5-7 pots per string, not beginning or ending on the first or last pot of a string. Due to logistical constraints, not all survey strings were sampled during biologist crewed trips.

Carapace lengths (CL) were recorded for legal and sublegal males, as well as females. Unmeasured crab were counted to obtain a catch number per size-sex catagory for each pot. On deck sampling procedure varied among vessels and crew as working conditions allowed, though biologists targeted CL records from at least \~ 30 crab per pot, with at least 10 of which being legal males. Females were given lowest priority and subsampled at a high rate. Sampling statistics from 2015 - 2023 are detailed in Table \ref{table:samplestats}.

## Survey CPUE {-}

Nominal survey CPUE of all male golden king crab ($U_{y}$) was computed as 

\begin{equation}
U_{y} = \frac{1}{k}\sum^{k}_{h = 1}{U_{h}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
U_{h} = \frac{1}{n_h}\sum^{n}_{i = 1}{U_{i,h}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
U_i,h = \frac{1}{m_{i}}\sum^{m}_{j = 1}{U_{j, i}}
\end{equation}

where 

$U_{h}$ = CPUE of stratum $h$ of $k$;  
$U_{i,h}$ = CPUE of string $i$ of $n$, within stratum $h$; and   
$U_{j,i}$ = CPUE of pot $j$ of $m$, within string $i$.  

Variance in $U_{y}$ ($\sigma^2_{U_y}$) was estimated as 

\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_{U_y} = \frac{1}{k^2}\sum^{k}_{h = 1}{\sigma^2_{U_{h}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_{U_h} = \frac{1}{n^2}\sum^{n}_{i = 1}{\sigma^2_{U_{i}}}
\end{equation}

Model based CPUE was estimated by a general additive mixed model (GAMM) in the form of 

\begin{equation}
\text{ln}(U_{j}) = \text{Year}_{y} + s(\text{soak time}) + s(\text{depth}) + (1 | \text{Stratum}_{h} / \text{String}_{i,y}) + \epsilon
\end{equation}

in which $\epsilon$ is negative binomial distributed error with $\theta$ estimated via maximum likelihood. GAMMs were estimated using the R library $gamm4$ (Wood and Scheipl 2020). The main difference between this and previous analyses was that zero catches were included in the data set. Data on zero-catch pots were not previously available to previous analyses (Jackson 2024). 

Simulated residuals were calculated using the R package $DHARMa$ (Hartig 2020). $DHARMa$ simulates a cumulative density function for each observation of the response variable for the fitted model and computes the residual as the value of the empirical density function at the value of the observed data. Residuals are standardized from 0 to 1 and distributed uniformly if the model is correctly specified.  

Residual patterns (below) in GAMM fit were addressed by removing anomalous soak times (> 25 days) which were from 15 strings aboard a single vessel in 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:stringmaprm}). Soak times were longer than expected due to mechanical issues than caused vessel delays. The survey does not have formal bounds on acceptable soak times. After removing long soak times, estimated degrees of freedom for smoothed terms suggested a linear fit to depth and soak time. The model was refit using the R library $glmmTMB$ (Brooks et al. 2017) to take advantage of Tweedie distribution implementation supported by the package $tweedie$ (Dunn 2022).

The annual CPUE index was extracted from model results following the same method as used for observer CPUE standardization (Jackson 2024, Appendix A).

# Results {-}

The GAMM fit to the complete data set suggested a dome shaped fit to soak time (EDF = 3.72) with a slow positive increase followed by a sharp decline at the largest values (i.e., roughly at 25 days) (Figure \ref{fig:gammsoaktime}). The marginal effect of depth was also dome shaped (EDF = 2.58), though nearly asymptotic (Figure \ref{fig:gammdepth}). DHARMa residuals indicated heteroscedasticity and further analysis suggested it was due to soak time (Figure \ref{fig:gammdiag1} and \ref{fig:gammdiag2}). 

Removing anomalous soak times (> 25 days) resolved the heteroskedasticity in the negative binomial GAMM, but suggested an excess of zeros for the negative binomial distribution. The updated model also reduced smooth terms to linear fits. DHARMa residuals indicated the Tweedie GLMM (p = 1.3) with linear depth and soak time was a better fit to the data (Figure \ref{fig:glmmdiag}). Marginal effects of soak time and depth are in Figure \ref{fig:glmmsoaktime} and \ref{fig:glmmdepth}, respectively. The resulting index follows a similar trend to the nominal CPUE (Table \ref{table:surveyindex}, Figure \ref{fig:indextimeseries}). The survey index is similar to the observer index, though with more extreme increase in 2018 and decrease in 2021 (Figure \ref{fig:indextimeseries}). Refitting and rescaling the observer standardization index with data from only 2015 - 2023 made little difference to the trend (Figure \ref{fig:indextimeseries}). 

Survey size composition showed little variability in the prominent mode, with most individuals measured between 125 - 175 mm CL. Sublegal males were more abundant in 2015 - 2019 surveys (Figure \ref{fig:sizecomp}).
