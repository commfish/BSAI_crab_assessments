# Background {-}

The AIGKC stock assessment has used catch per unit effort (CPUE) data collected by at-sea observers and fish ticket data as a primary index of stock abundance since model development began (Siddeek et al. 2017 SAFE; Siddeek et al. 2016). Standardized indices are estimated for three periods: 1) fish ticket CPUE from 1985 - 1998, 2) observer CPUE during the pre-rationalized period (1995 - 2004), and 3) observer CPUE during the post-rationalized period (2005 - 2023). This appendix details updates to the CPUE standardization process for the the post-rationalized period for which there is new observer data. It also includes explorations of CPUE standardization using spatiotemporal models to be further evaluated during the next assessment cycle.

# Post-Rationalized CPUE Index {-}
## Major Changes {-}

The only changes in CPUE standardization relative to the 2024 final assessment is the addition of observer data collected during the 2024/25 season.

## Methods {-}
### Core Data Preparation {-}

Observer data sets were limited to pots that represented core fishing effort in attempt to remove observations that may not be indicate of overal fishing performance. Core vessels and permit holders during the pre-rationalized time series were those that participated in more than a single season. The fleet was consolidated enough in the post-rationalized time series that reductions on number of vessels and permit holders were not warranted. Following Siddeek et al. (2016, 2023) several gear types were combined, and pot types not typical to the directed fishery were removed. Since many fishing seasons in the pre-rationalized era did not align with the crab year used in the post-rationalized era (July - June), crab year was assigned to pre-2005 data $post$ $hoc$. Observer pots sampled on dates that fall after June 30 in a given season, were assigned the next crab year (Siddeek et al. 2016, 2023). Soak time and depth data were truncated by removing the outer 5\% and 1\% of distributions, respectively.

### Model Fitting {-}

CPUE standardization models were fit using general additive models (GAM) as implemented in the R package $mgcv$ (Wood 2004). Negative binomial and Tweedie error distributions with a log link were evaluated during the 2024 final assessment (Jackson 2024 Appendix A). Negative binomial GAMs performed best for the pre-rationalized period, while Tweedie GAMs performed better for the post-rationalized period. Since this analysis only updates the standardization of post-rationalized CPUE data, only Tweedie models were considered. The power variable, $p$, that relates the Tweedie mean to its variance was estimated as a model parameter. All splines were fit as thin plate regression splines, with smoothness determined by generalized cross-validation (Wood 2004). 

### Variable Selection {-}

Null models included only crab year as an explanatory variable

\begin{equation}
\text{ln}(CPUE_{i}) = Year_{y,i}
\end{equation}

The full scope of models evaluated included gear (i.e., pot size), vessel, permit holder (i.e., proxy for captain), month and block (i.e., discrete geographic subarea, Figure \ref{fig:blockmap}) as factorial variables. Prospective smoothed terms include soak time, depth, and slope angle. Sea floor slope angle (degrees) was computed in ArcGIS (Redlands, 2011) from a 100-m resolution raster surface of Aleutian Islands bathymetry (Zimmermann 2013). Addition of new variables were considered significant if AIC decreased by at least two per degree of freedom lost and R$^2$ increased by at least 0.01. Variables were added (or subtracted) from the model until no candidate variables met AIC and R$^2$ criteria. Consistent AIC (CAIC; -2LogLik+(ln($n$)+1)$p$; Bozdogan 1987) was used instead of the traditional AIC, in which $n$ is the number of observations and $p$ is the number of parameters (Siddeek et al. 2016, 2023). If forward and backward selection produced conflicting results, the best model was determined by CAIC.

\begin{equation}
\text{R}^{2}=\frac{D_{Null} - D_{Resid}}{D_{Null}}
\end{equation}

### Model Diagnostics {-}

Simulated residuals were calculated using the R package $DHARMa$ (Hartig 2020). $DHARMa$ simulates a cumulative density function for each observation of the response variable for the fitted model and computes the residual as the value of the empirical density function at the value of the observed data. Residuals are standardized from 0 to 1 and distributed uniformly if the model is correctly specified.  

Partial effects were plotted to view the relationship between CPUE and individual variables. Step plots that show the change the standardized index with addition of each explanatory variable were also examined to consider the influence of each variable (Bishop et al. 2008; Bentley et al. 2012).

### CPUE index {-}

Following Siddeek et al. (2016, 2023) standardized CPUE index was extracted from the models as the year coefficient ($\beta_i$) with the first level set to zero and scaled to canonical coefficients ($\beta^\prime_i$) as 

\begin{equation}
\beta^{\prime}_{i} = \frac{\beta_{i}}{\bar{\beta}} 
\end{equation}  

where

\begin{equation}
\bar{\beta} = \sqrt[n_{j}]{\prod_{j = 1}^{n_j}{\beta_{i,j}}}
\end{equation}
  
and $n_j$ is the number of levels in the year variable. Nominal CPUE was scaled by the same method for comparison. 

## Results {-}

Forward and backward selection resulted in different 'best' models in both subdistricts. The best forward selection model in the EAG included (in addition to year) permit holder, gear type, and soak time, whereas backwards selection included vessel, month, gearcode, and soak time (Table \ref{table:posteagres}). The backward selection model was chosen for index standardization ($\Delta$ AIC = -XXX). In the WAG, forward selection resulted in a model including vessel, gear type, and month, whereas backward selection included permit holder instead of month and was used for index standardization ($\Delta$ AIC = -38.08) (Table \ref{table:postwagres}). Residual diagnostics did not indicate misspecification in best models for either subdistrict (Figure \ref{fig:posteagdharmatw} and \ref{fig:postwagdharmatw}).  

Standardized indices differed minimally from null model indices. Vessel and permit holder appeared to have the largest influence on the resulting index in the EAG and WAG, respectively (Figure\ref{fig:posteagstdstep} and \ref{fig:postwagstdstep}). Standardized indices track nominal indices, as expected. Relative to the 2023/4, both subdistricts underwent a decrease in CPUE (Figure \ref{fig:postindex}).

# Spatiotemporal GAMM {-}

Several efforts have been made to account for spatial and spatiotemporal variability in fishing effort and CPUE including specifying large-scale blocks within subdistricts (here; Siddeek et al. 2016), interactions between blocks and year (Jackson 2024, Siddeek et al. 2023), non-parametric smooths of latitude and longitude, and interactions between year and smooth terms (Jackson 2024). Geostatistical models may provide better utility over previous approaches given their ability to estimate spatial correlations and account for varying spatial coverage (Maunder et al. 2020).

## Methods {-}

### Data Preparation {-}

Core observer data preparation was the same as used for the 2025 final assessment CPUE standardization, with some minor changes to gear types included. Pot sizes 4'x4', 10'x10', 8'x8' (EAG only), and 6.5'x7' (WAG only) were removed due to small sample sizes. Pot locations were transforms to UTM coordinates using zone 2N.

### GAMM {-}

Saptiotemporal GAMMs were constructed using the R package \textit{sdmTMB} and \textit{sdmTMBextra} (R Core Team 2024; Anderson et al., 2022; Anderson et al., 2025). This approach models spatial random effects as a series of Gaussian random fields, which are approximated using stochastic partial differential equation matrices (SPDE) (Lindgren et al., 2011). Correlation of spatial random effects is constrained by the Mat$\'{e}$rn covariance function (Anderson et al., 2022).  

The underlying spatial domain of the model was represented by a triangular mesh constructed using k-means clustering with 150 knots. Spatial polygons of the Aleutian Islands were downloaded using the R package \textit{geodata} (Hijmans et al., 2025) and used as barriers to spatial correlation within the mesh. Mesh construction was not rigorously evaluated for these explorations and should be revisited in future analyses.

In addition to year, gear type was included as a factor covariate, soak time and depth were included as smooth splines as described above, and vessel was included as a random effect. Since soak time have increased over time as fishery has become consolidated and competition has decreased, models with a soak time:year interaction were also evaluated. Models assumed a Tweedie error distribution with log link function and estimated power variable, $p$. Spatiotemporal random fields were modeled as independent and identically distributed process. Pre- and post-rationalization periods were fit in a single model to 1) leverage the most available data within the standardization model, and 2) avoid fitting two non-overlapping indices in the assessment model (Hoyle et al., 2024).

### Model Diagnostics {-}

Model diagnosis utilized $DHARMa$ residuals following the approach described above. Several other diagnostics including tests of convergence and range of parameter estimates are built in to $sdmTMB$. Differences between observed and fitted values were also plotted over the spatial domain to identify any patterns.

### Index Prediction {-}

Standardized CPUE index was estimated by constructing a prediction data set based on vertices of the model mesh. Soak time and depth were set to mean values, while gear type and vessel were set to mode values. Predictions were summed across the spatial domain using area weighting.Annual estimates where then scaled to canonical coefficients as described above.




## Results {-}

All models successfully converged and DHARMa residuals did not identify misspecifications.
