\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The SSC recommends that the CPT explore whether to conduct this final assessment on the same cycle as other crab assessments in September/October to better align the assessment with the annual cycle of catch mortality. }"

\textbf{Response}: ADF$\&$G and the CPT do not think moving the timing of the final assessment to September would be suitable because the fishery opens in August.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The current method of projecting the remaining landings for the current incomplete season seems overly complicated and the SSC recommends a more straightforward method for determining total catch be considered, such as basing it on the average fraction harvested to date. }"

\textbf{Response}: See response to this comment in the 2024 SAFE. If the directed fishery is incomplete at the time of the final assessment, total catch will be computed as usual, though assuming the TAC is achieved and CPUE remains the same as at the time data were pulled. Total effort will estimated by dividing the TAC in terms of the estimated number of crab by current CPUE. See Appendix A of Jackson (2024a) for details of total catch estimation.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Use the standard convention for model numbering, i.e. the models for the May 2025 assessment, will be 25.xx and not 24.xx.}"

\textbf{Response}: This is done.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Document why the 1993 bycatch and total catch size-composition data are not included in this and past assessments.}"

\textbf{Response}: Issues with 1993 observer data (not bycatch) have been resolved by model 23.1 (data). There was no observer coverage in the 1993 crab year for EAG directed fishing and for WAG, most pots were previously removed because they were of unknown size. Those pots are no included for size composition data only, which also affects total catch estimation.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Explore reasons for the retrospective pattern for the EAG.}"

\textbf{Response}: The retrospective pattern in the MMB is resulting from some process influencing fit to CPUE index. Fits to no other data source showed a strong retrospective bias. Pin-pointing the specific misspecification resulting in this issue is an onoing effort.

\end{itemize}

## Updates to Base Model {-}

The 2024 final assessment was conducted using GMACS version 2.01.M.10. This document uses the updated version 2.20.16. Small changes in the likelihood values of priors are expected, though all other model processes should be unchanged for this stock. Model 23.1 and all previous GMACS models for this assessment used the following annual structure consisting of six seasons: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Instantaneous: Start of year, output numbers at size;}

\item{July 1 to the mid-point of the directed fishery: Natural mortality;}

\item{Instantaneous: Removal of directed catch, bycatch, fit index and size composition;}

\item{Mid-point of the directed fishery to February 15: Natural mortality;}

\item{Instantaneous: Estimate MMB;}

\item{February 15 - June 30: Natural mortality, recruitment, growth.}

\end{enumerate}

Annual structure was reconfigured by swapping the duration of seasons five and six. Season five now runs from February 15 - June 30, with the same model process occurring, though with the addition of MMB estimation. MMB is estimated at the beginning of a season, so there is no changed to estimates. Season six is now instantaneous (June 30) and is used to output numbers at size so that the ADF\&G harvest strategy can utilize estimated legal male abundance as close to the upcoming fishery as possible. Nothing happens during season 1, which has length zero and serves as a place holder. This is a small process change that has no effect on model results or reference point calculation (Table \ref{table:versionllik} and \ref{table:versionref}).

### Observer Coverage During the 1993/94 Fishery {-}

Previous assessment models removed observer data for the EAG in 1993, but retained those data for the WAG (Jackson 2024b; Siddeek et al., 2023). The CPT recommended investigating those data and better documenting the reason for use or non-use.  

Prior to 1996, the longitudinal dividing line between the EAG and WAG was 171^$\circ$ W lon, and fishing seasons did not conform to the post-rationalization crab year. Jackson (2024a) re-computed time series data by applying the current management boundary (174^$\circ$ W lon) and crab year to these early time series data. The 1993/94 season in the EAG (east of 171^$\circ$ W lon) was open from September 1, 1993 to March 1, 1994, and there was no observer coverage in the EAG during that season. Observer data that are assigned to the 1993/94 EAG season were actually from the easternmost portion (174^$\circ$ W lon - 171^$\circ$ W lon) of the WAG fishery in 1992/93, which ran from November 1, 1992 to August 15, 1993 (i.e., July 1 - August 15, 1993 get assigned to the 1993/94 crab year). Previous assessment include these data as part of the 1993/94 EAG retained catch and retained size composition, but remove these data from the total catch and total size composition time series, which seems appropriate.

Observer size composition for the WAG in 1993/94 was also flagged as suspect, given the stark difference between those data and the surrounding seasons. Observer data for WAG that are assigned to the 1993/94 season come from both the 1992/93 and 1993/94 seasons, and size composition was recorded for all observer pots. Previous assessments removed various uncommon or non-target species gear types by recommendation from the fleet (M. Siddeek, ADF\&G personal communication, 2023). Those include: Dungeness crab pots, pyramid pots, conical pots, hair crab pots, snail pots, cods, dome shaped pots, ADF\&G research pots with stretch mesh instead of escape rings, and rectangular pots measuring 9'x 9', 8 1/2' x 8 1/2', 9 1/2' x 9 1/2', 8' x 9', 8' x 10', 9' x 10', 7' x 8', or with unknown dimension. In 1993, nearly all WAG observer (162 / 174) pots belonged to one of those categories, mostly unknown sized rectangular pots (160). Including all rectangular pots has little impact on the size composition in other years in either subdistrict, so the total size composition time series was revised to include all rectangular pots (Figure \ref{fig:eagobstotcomp} and \ref{fig:wagobstotcomp}). Changes to total size composition data also have a minor impact on total catch estimates (Table \ref{table:totalcatch}). Pot types included in CPUE estimation will remain unchanged. These difference are evaluated in model 23.1 (data), for which there was very little difference in model results (Figures \ref{fig:eagobstotcomp} - \ref{fig:dataupdatetotcatch}) or reference points (Table \ref{table:versionref}).

## Recruitment Bias Correction {-}

Model 23.1 suggests steadily decreasing MMB from 1960 - 1981 due to how previous versions of GMACS implemented bias correction of log recruitment deviations. Model 23.1 estimated initial recruitment as a model parameter (R$_0$) and recruitment by year is estimated as series of annual deviations. Log-deviations have a tendency to go to zero in lieu of data, though standard errors are large and decrease as the spin up period approaches the beginning of the data time series in 1981. GMACS version 2.01.M.10 added $e^{\frac{\sigma^2}{2}}$ to expected values of log-deviations, resulting in decreasing recruitment, and thus MMB. Model 23.1c implemented bias correction as $b_t e^{\frac{\sigma^2}{2}}$, in which $b_t$ is a vector of 0 for years preceding data (1960 - 1980) and 1 for years with time series data (1981 - 2023).

## Intitial conditions {-}

Previous assessment models started in 1960 assuming in the population was in an unfished state, with no fishing mortality until 1891 (Siddeek et al. 2023; Jackson 2024b). Model 25.0 starts in a non-equilibrium state in 1981 and initial numbers at size were estimated from parameters representing initial recruitment (R$_{init}$) and scaled deviates for each size class. The size bin at which crab first become legal retained, 136 - 140 mm CL, was used as the reference size class.

## Data Weighting {-}

### Base model data weighting {-}

Recent CPT and SSC comments reflect a need to reevaluate data weighting. The data weighting scheme for the base model was as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\textbf{Catch Data}: Retained catch $cv$ was assumed to be 0.0316 for all years and the emphasis ($\lambda$) on the likelihood is $\lambda$ = 4. Total catch $cv$ was the graded number of observer sampled pots with non-zero catches ($m_{nz,i}$) in which the maximum weight ($\omega_{i}$) is max[$\omega_{i}$] = 250, scaled as 

\begin{equation}
cv_{i} = \sqrt{e^{\frac{1}{2\omega_{i}}}-1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\omega_{i}=\frac{\text{max}[\omega_{i}]m_{nz,i}}{\text{max}[m_{nz,i}]}
\end{equation}

Likelihood emphasis for total catch was $\lambda$ = 2. Groundfish bycatch $cv$ is assumed to be 1.3108 for all years and $\lambda$ = 1.}

\item{\textbf{Index Data}: Standard errors of year coefficients from CPUE standardization models were used to compute annual $cv$ for each of the index series. Observer index $cv$ ranged from 0.017 - 0.049 in the EAG and 0.019 - 0.059 in the WAG. Fish ticket $cv$ was slightly greater, ranging from 0.044 - 0.178 in the EAG to 0.038 - 0.093 in the WAG. Since these estimates were overly precise due to the vast number of observer and fish ticket records, additional $cv$ was estimated as a parameter for each series. Additional $cv$ estimates were larger than observed $cv$ for all indices, between 0.15 - 0.23 in the EAG, and 0.06 - 0.24 in the WAG (Table 10 and 11; Jackson 2024b). Likelihood emphasis for all index series was $\lambda$ = 1.}

\item{\textbf{Size Composition Data}: The base model assumed a multinomial error distribution for size composition data with effective sample size based on the number of vessel days and observer days for retained and total size composition data, respectively. Effective sample sizes were tuned using the Francis (2011) method for the multinomial. Based model Francis weights were $\lambda_{ret}$ = 0.209 and $\lambda_{tot}$ = 0.432 in the EAG and $\lambda_{ret}$ = 0.143 and $\lambda_{tot}$ = 0.521 in the WAG. Likelihood emphasis for both size composition series was $\lambda$ = 1.}

\item{\textbf{Tagging Data}: Sample size for growth data were the tag return sample sizes and likelihood emphasis was $\lambda$ = 1.}

\end{itemize}

### Likelihood Emphasis {-}

Likelihood emphasis factors ($\lambda$) provide a means of weighting the sum of likelihood components to influence the overall model fit. The accepted model (23.1) assigns the most weight to retained ($\lambda_{ret}$ = 4) and total ($\lambda_{tot}$ = 2) catch data. Model 25.0a evaluated resetting all likelihood emphasis factors equal to 1 (i.e., all data sources weighted equally). 

Model 25.0b2 explores increasing emphasis on index data ($\lambda$ = 2). This model is not an attempt to resolve the data conflict in the EAG, but to force a better fit to index data without a change in assumptions and examine the sensitivity in other model processes.

### Multinomial Effective Sample Size {-}

Model 25.0b evaluates Francis weighting of size composition data using sample sizes based on variability in the data. Stage 1 effective sample sizes $N_{eff}$ were estimated using a bootstrap approach based on Stewart and Hamel (2014). The resampling design was two-staged, first within the primary sampling unit (delivery or observer pot) and second by individual crab. Resampling was done with replacement to observed sample sizes. Effective sample size for a given year was estimated as 

\begin{equation}
N_{eff} = \frac{ \sum_{l} {P_{l}(1 - P_{l})}}{\sum_{l}{(P_{l} - B_{l})^{2}}}
\end{equation}

where $P_{l}$ and $B_{l}$ are the observed and bootstrap proportion of crab measured in length bin, $l$, respectively. Annual estimates of effective sample size were computed as the mean of 500 replicates for each year for the retained size composition and 100 replicates for each year for the total size composition. Resampling iterations were low due to computational needs. Estimated $N_{eff}$ are in Table \ref{table:retneff} and \ref{table:totneff}. Since estimated $N_{eff}$ was quite large for many years, observed stage 1 sample sizes were reduced to 

\begin{equation}
N_{eff}^{\prime} = \text{min}(2000,N_{eff})
\end{equation}

### Dirichlet Multinomial {-}

Model 25.0c assumes the Dirichlet multinomial error distribution for both series of size composition data (Thorson et al. 2017). Stage 1 effective sample sizes were the same as model 25.0b. Model 25.0a also assumes the Dirichlet multinomial for size composition data, but uses stage 1 effective sample sizes from model 25.0a. This was included to illustrate that the Dirichlet overdispersion parameter hits the upper bound ($\beta_{DM}$ [UB] = 1,000) with smaller input sample sizes than used in model 25.0c, indicating that the estimated sample size was larger than the input sample size.

## Cooperative Survey {-} 

The AIGKC cooperative pot survey was initiated in 2015 and has continued every year since, with the exception of 2020. The survey has been confined to the EAG in all years but 2018, when it was extended to the WAG. Appendix A details the survey design and analytical approach. Briefly, an index of total male abundance was estimated from a Tweedie GLMM that included fixed, parametric effects of soak time (days) and depth with string as a random effect nested within survey subarea. Survey size composition was estimated by the same method as observer data, and effective sampling size was estimated using the bootstrap approach described above.

Model assumptions relating to survey data include:

\begin{itemize}

\item{The survey occurs during season 3 (same as the directed fishery);}

\item{There is no extra CV estimated for the survey index;}

\item{Catchability is estimated independent of the directed fshery;}

\item{Selectivity is logistic and estimated independent of the directed fishery;}

\item{There is no retention or handling mortality. Retention of legal crab is accounted for in the directed fishery catch. Thus, $\bar{F}$ = 0 and $F_{35\%}$ is not applied to this fleet;}

\item{Size composition data are fit using a multinomial likelikhood with input sample sizes tuned using Francis weighting (Model 25.1) or the Dirichlet multinomial (model 25.1b).}

\item{Survey size composition data are independent of observer (i.e., total) size composition data. Observers are not deployed during survey trips.}

\end{itemize}


# Results and Discussion {-}

## Initial Conitions {-}

Changing the basis correction on recruitment proceeding 1981 (model 23.1c) resulted in a flatter MMB trend in years preceding data, but did not totally eliminate the decreasing ramp in the EAG (\ref{fig:icmmb}). Changes in recruitment bias correction had only marginal effect, if any, on other model processes. Starting the model in 1981 increased recruitment in the starting year in both subdistricts, and to a lesser extent from 2017 - 2023 in the EAG. The size distribution of recruits was the same among models. The 1981 recruitment estimate has little effect on other model processes. The only data pre-1985 are retained catch data. Retained size composition data starts in 1985 and total catch data begins in 1990. Differences in fits to size composition and index data were minimal, though present in several years in both subdistricts. There was an increase in $MMB_{prj}$ in the EAG for model 25.0 (Table XXX), owing to the small increase in recruitment and MMB towards the end of the time series. Despite there being a small change in recruitment, starting the model in 1981 is preferred as it slightly reduces the number of estimable parameters and eliminates the issue of decreasing MMB and recruitment before the data time series.

## Data Weighting {-}

Reducing the emphasis on retained and total catch data so that likelihood component are equally weighted had little impact on model results in either subdistrict. Bootstrap estimated $N_{eff}$ for size composition data were highly variable and larger than the observed number of crab measured in many cases. This is possible when bootstrap proportion at size approximates observed size composition with high precision. Annual mean of bootstrap $N_{eff}$ were less than observed sample sizes in all years. Sample sizes were largest for the retained catch in the 1990s and have stabilized since the 2000s when sampling design restricted effort. Observer sample size tended to align With the ......(Table XXX; Figure XXX). 

Francis weighting with bootstrap estimated stage one $N_{eff}$ (model 25.0b) had little impact on fits to catch and size composition data in both subdistricts. Francis weights were smaller than in model 25.0a and resulted in a similar stage two $N_{eff}$ for retained size composition and an approximate time series average of model 25.0a for total size composition (most years had stage one $N_{eff}$ capped at 2000) (Figure \ref{fig:wtneff}). Model 25.0b estimated slightly lower recruitment from 2020 - 2023, which is reflected in fit to index data and estimated MMB (Figure \ref{fig:wtrec} and \ref{fig:wtmmb}).  

Model 25.0c estimated $N_{eff}$ for both retained and total size composition data considerably higher than models that used Francis weighting (Figure \ref{fig:wtneff}). Estimated $N_{eff}$ for model 25.0d was the same as stage one sample sizes since overdispersion ($\beta_{DM}$) reached its upper bound for both size composition series. Increased weighting of size composition data by Dirichlet multinomial models resulted in larger estimates of added $CV$ on post-rationalized observer CPUE data, thus down weighting those data (Table \ref{table:addcv}). Naturally, fits to index data in the EAG were worse for models 25.0c and 25.0d (Figure \ref{fig:wteagindex}). This was also the case in the WAG to a lesser degree (Figure \ref{fig:wtwagindex}). Increasing emphasis on index data (model 25.0b2) resulted in much lower Francis weights than model 25.0b and near zero additional CV on post-rationalized index data for the EAG (Table \ref{table:addcv}; Figure \ref{fig:wteagindex}) (i.e., the tuning process down weighted size composition and further increased weight on index data, fitting the data near exactly). Weights tuning was less sensitive to increasing index likelihood emphasis in the WAG, but had the same general effect.

Fits to size composition data were good and differed little among models (Figure \ref{fig:wtcomp}). All models characterize mean size of the retained catch well in the first half of the time series, and then tended to under predict and then over predict mean size during stretches of years in both subdistricts (Figure \ref{fig:wteagretsize} and \ref{fig:wtwagretsize}). This pattern was least prevalent in model 25.0c and 25.0d, as those models weighted size composition data more. All models except 25.0b2 in the EAG characterized mean carapace length of the total size composition well (Figure \ref{fig:wteagtotsize} and \ref{fig:wtwagtotsize}).  

Model 25.0c estimated lower recruitment from 2014 - 2023 in the EAG, but not the WAG. Forcing a better fit to post-rationalized observer CPUE (model 23.0b2) resulted in large, annual swings in recruitment in the EAG (Figure \ref{fig:wtrec}). Such large annual fluctuations are likely implausible. In general, WAG recruitment was less sensitive to data weight in the latter part of the time series that in the EAG. Model 25.0c estimated lower MMB from 2014 - 2023 in the EAG, following the same trend in recruitment (i.e., recruitment can occur at maturity). Model 25.0b2 estimated a different MMB trajectory than other models in the EAG, and inter-annual differences were somewhat erratic (Figure \ref{fig:mmb}). All other EAG models had similar MMB estimates, with models 25.0 and 25.0a being slightly greater than models 25.0b and 25.0d (models with bootstrap $N_{eff}$) at the end of the time series. MMB was less sensitive to data weighting in the WAG (Figure \ref{fig:mmb}). 

## Cooperative Survey {-}

Models 25.1 and 25.1b added the EAG cooperative survey as an additional fleet. Appendix A details estimation of the cooperative survey index and size composition data. Fits to survey index roughly followed the average survey index from 2015 - 2019, and decreased in 2022 and 2023. Predicted survey index did not capture the large decrease in 2021 (Figure \ref{fig:surveyindex}). Both models that included the cooperative survey fit post-rationalized observer CPUE similar to model 25.0c (Figure \ref{fig:surveyindex}). Estimates of additional $CV$ were larger than models without survey data (Table \ref{table:addcv}).

Both models fit survey size composition data reasonably well, except for in 2018 - the only year in which survey size composition substantially deviates from the fishery total size composition (Figure \ref{fig:surveycomp}; Appendix A Figure XXX). Francis weighting (model 25.1) resulted in lower weights on size composition survey size composition data than the Dirichlet multinomial (model 25.1b), though predicted proportions at size were not very different. 

Recruitment estimates tended to align closely with model the parent model (25.0a or 25.0c) until the beginning of the survey time series, at which both models 25.1 and 25.1b undergo a steeper decline mirroring model 25.0c (Figure \ref{fig:surveyrec}). Estimated MMB followed a similar trajectory, with both models estimating terminal year MMB considerably lower than the base model (Figure \ref{fig:surveymmb}).

Previous efforts to incorporate the cooperative survey spliced survey CPUE into the observer time series (Siddeek et al. 2023) and included the survey as a separate fleet, but allowed for estimation of additional $CV$ on index data (Jackson 2024). Models 25.1 and 25.1b are the most appropriate use of the survey data that have been presented thus far. Including the survey data does not appear to necessarily improve overall model performance (as mentioned above it actually results in down weighting and poorer fit to index data). Since MMB and management quantities do appear to be sensitive to the addition of survey data, there should be careful consideration of whether the survey design appropriately captures population trends. Scrutiny should be paid to 

\begin{itemize}

\item {\textbf{Primary Sampling}: The current survey analysis post-stratified survey stations (i.e., strings) based on the three strata design implemented since 2022. Number of stations per stratum has varied annually, as has ability to pick strings set at all selected stations. Further vessels tend to not overlap in the survey footprint, so vessel effects would be masked by spatial variability, or vice versa.  

The 2024 survey was the first year in the survey time series where the spatial footprint did not span the entire EAG - how to best incorporate those data is yet to be determined.}

\item {\textbf{Secondary Sampling}: The target number of pots to sample per string is 5 - 7, avoiding first and last. In YYYY, were a number of strings that sampled a more than 7 pots, in which that string also had several zero pots or otherwise low CPUE.}

\item {\textbf{Tertiary Sampling}: }

# Author Recommendation {-}

Three models should be brought forward for the final May 2025 assessment: 23.1c, 25.0a, and 25.1. Model 23.1c should replace the 2024 accepted model in the 2025 final assessment. There is negligible difference between models after the start of the data time series in 1981, and removing bias correction pre-1981 is correct given the lack of data. Relative to 23.1c, model 25.0a starts the model in a non-equilibrium state and uses equal emphasis factors ($\lambda = 1$) on all likelihood components. Reducing emphasis on retained and total catch had minimal impact on model fit and establishes a level platform for further exploring model misspecification and data weighting. Model 25.1 is evaluated for the EAG only and uses the cooperative survey as an additional fleet. The cooperative survey time series has been developing since 2015 and this analysis is the most appropriate use of survey data presented, thus far.

# Previously Addressed Comments {-}
## SSC Feb 2024 {-}

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The SSC recommends that any new substantial standardization changes should be reviewed during the next cycle, not during specifications in May/June 2024}

\textbf{Response}: The only revisions to CPUE standardization between model explorations and the final assessment addressed poor model diagnostics, though this will be noted for the future.
\makebox[165 mm]{\dotfill}


## CPT Jan 2024 {-}

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The CPT recommends that the CPUE standardization be revised for the 2024 assessment by:}  
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textit{exploring the use of a Tweedie instead of the negative binomial distribution;}}
\item{\textit{dropping the data for gear types 4 and 13 which have few observations;}}
\item{\textit{reporting DHARMa residuals and providing influence plots as additional diagnostics; and}}
\item{\textit{exploring the basic data used for the fish ticket CPUE index because the data on which
the standardization is based for the current analyses include many zero observations –
this may be because the extracted data may include trips for red king crab in the
Aleutians. If the residual pattern for the fish ticket analysis (Fig. 44 of Appendix B) is not
resolved, results should be presented in May 2024 for model runs that use and ignore
the fish ticket CPUE index.}"}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Response}: All of these recommendations were addressed in CPUE standardization except dropping gear types 4 and 13. This recommendation will be followed up in 2025 model explorations.

## SSC June 2023 {-}

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The SSC agrees with the CPT recommendation for a 25\% buffer for this assessment and supports the resulting ABC.

\textbf{Response}: Retrospective analyses were performed here, and jitter analysis will be performed on the author preferred model in the final assessment.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The SSC places a high priority on incorporating information from the cooperative survey into the assessment and supports the CPT recommendation that this be incorporated as a separate fleet.}"

\textbf{Response}: Model 23.2 explores the utility of the pot survey as an additional fleet.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Further examination of the retrospective pattern in terms of magnitude, direction and cause continues to be important.}"

\textbf{Response}: More work will be done to address the retrospective pattern in the EAG during the next cycle.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Revisit the choice to maintain the recruitment years at 1987 – 2017 rather than successively adding recent years to the time series, as is done for other crab stocks.}"

\textbf{Response}: See response to similar comment above.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The CPT recommended removing the data on the smallest size bin for the total catch prior to 2005/2006. The SSC requests first plotting these data and the model fit and providing further consideration of why these data may or may not be representative of the fishery at that time.}"

\textbf{Response}: For clarification, the CPT recommended to removed data on crab below the smallest size bin (i.e. $\leq$ 100 mm) that were being included in the 101-105 mm bin.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The current method of projecting the remaining landings for the current incomplete season seems overly complicated and the SSC recommends that a more straightforward method for determining total catch be considered, such as basing it on the average fraction harvested to date.}"

\textbf{Response}: In May 2024, total catch will be determined using the effort required to achieve the TAC at current CPUE on the date when data were pulled. See Appendix A for details of total catch estimation.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Further analysis and discussion of the retrospective pattern is needed to justify the size of the buffer used.}"

\textbf{Response}: This will be noted during the final assessment in May 2024.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Continue work to obtain an index using the cooperative pot survey data for use in the EAG assessment model.}"

\textbf{Response}: Model 23.2 explores the utility of the pot survey as an additional fleet.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Plot observed vs. predicted values for fitted data to help diagnose misfits.}"

\textbf{Response}: It's unclear what model process this is referring to. When applicable, observations are always plotted with fitted data in this document.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Add confidence intervals to plots of fits to catch data (i.e., retained catch, total catch) reflecting assumed data uncertainty.}"

\textbf{Response}: All plots of catch and index data now include confidence intervals.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Perform retrospective analyses for all models that have the potential to serve as the basis for calculating reference points.}"

\textbf{Response}: Retrospective analyses were performed for all EAG and WAG models, and presented for 22.1e2, 23.0a, 23.1, 23.1b, 23.2, and AI 23.1b.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The cooperative survey should be fit as an additional CPUE index, not substituted for existing indices as was done for models 22.1g and 22.1h.}"

\textbf{Response}: That is what has been explored here.    
\makebox[165 mm]{\dotfill}

<!-- ---- -->

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Size-composition data should not include a “minus” group (i.e., crab smaller than the smallest size bin used in the model).}"

\textbf{Response}: This is rectified by model 23.1.    
\makebox[165 mm]{\dotfill}

<!-- ---- -->

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{The data used to determine the total catch size-compositions in the two areas should be re-examined to determine whether the abundances in the smallest size bin from 1990 to 2004 are correct.}"

\textbf{Response}: Appendix A recomputes size composition time series using data directly pulled from the observer database. Updated time series still appear to contain a disproportionate amount crab 101-105 mm CL, even without minus-sized crab (model 23.1). This is possibly do to escape mesh not being required until the 1997 season.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Explore models that provide better fits to EAG CPUE data.}"

\textbf{Response}:  More work in this area is needed during the next cycle.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Use GAMs rather than GLMs to standardize the CPUE indices (e.g., use the R package “mgcv”).}"

\textbf{Response}: All models derivative of 23.0a take this approach.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{Show both the original CV’s and effective CV’s (i.e., incorporating additional variance) when showing fits to the CPUE index time series.}"

\textbf{Response}: This has been done in all plots showing fits to CPUE index.

\textbf{Comment}: "\textit{In the SAFE document}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Add a note to explain that retained catch can exceed TAC in some years due to the cost recovery fishery associated with the cooperative survey.}
\item \textit{Drop Appendix D.}
\item \textit{Remove tier designation from area-specific management Table.}
\item \textit{Add explanation for extrapolation of total catch in final year"}
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Response}: All items will be addressed in the May 2024 SAFE document.
