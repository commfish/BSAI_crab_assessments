# Summary {-}
The model explorations presented here include some of those suggested by CPT and SSC, and updates to GMACS. All GMACS updates were tested to ensure model fit (likelihood values, output, etc.) matched the last accepted base model. The model exploration presented here solely focus on selectivity - specifically assumptions for selectivity using the BSFRF data as a prior. The models presented here are the beginning of work to explore these topics and the author acknowledges that further exploration is warranted. Model variants were performed using both the accepted 2023 model - 23.0a and the previously accepted base - 21.1b. Additionally, models were updated to reflect a correction in the season in which MMB is calculated, which was season 6 but now is season 7. This was a correction that minimally affects the estiamted MMB and associated reference points. 

The results of these model explorations are presented in this document in section C. Background on the Bristol Bay red king crab modeling approach, modeling framework (GMACS), and history of the stock and fisheries can be found in the last full SAFE published on the NPFMC website and will not be repeated here.

# B. Responses to SSC and CPT  {-}

## CPT and SSC Comments on Assessments in General {-}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Respeonse to SSC Comments (June 2023, Oct 2023):**


**Response to SSC Comments (June 2022, Oct 2022):**

*"The SSC recommends that the RKC authors work together to complete a stock structure template for June 2023."*

Response: A structure template for RKC in the Bering Sea was presented for CPT and SSC at the Sept 2023 CPT meeting (Oct 2023 SSC). 

*"The SSC suggests that the CPT develop guidelines for when to change model start dates"*

Response: This topic was taken up at the Jan 2023 CPT meeting, with some basic guidelines presented in those minutes that included keeping data unless there was a strong reason (environmental, poor data quality, model instability) to exclude the data and data exclusion did not lead to drastic model output changes. Model 22.0, where data starts in 1985 vs 1975, was presented in May/Sept 2023 but was not adopted. Changes to input data are not considered currently unless the CPT changes their guidance on data inclusion.

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments (from February 2022):**

*“The SSC supports the CPT general recommendations that all stock assessments include results from the currently accepted model with new data (base model) so that changes in model performance can be assessed. Values for management-related quantities for all models that may be recommended by the CPT or SSC should also be available.”* 

Response: These recommendations are reflected in the document. 

## CPT and SSC Comments on BBRKC assessment {-}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2021):** 

*“The CPT was concerned that the ‘information’ content of the data with respect to natural mortality could be related to strong assumptions elsewhere in the model, and recommended further exploration of natural mortality after September and suggested attending the June 2021 CAPAM workshop on natural mortality, which may provide some insights into best practices. A large increase in estimated natural mortality would likely increase fishing mortality reference points, with management implications.”*

Response: Model runs in May 2022/2023 addressed some variations on M. Estimated M values in the length-based crab models tend to have higher values than the other approaches, and confounding among estimated M, survey selectivity/catchability, and recruitment in a length-based model makes it difficult to accurately estimate M in the model. The base model accepted in fall 2024 includes an estimated M for males using a tight prior. Further exploration of the appropriateness of this prior are planned. 

*“The CPT was interested in more exploration of the retrospective patterns, which seem to have increased since the last assessment despite no new data being added. Reported Mohn’s rhos were starting to reach concerning magnitudes in the proposed models?”*

Response: Higher than expected BSFRF survey biomass during 2007-2008 and 2013-2016 and NMFS survey biomass in 2014 likely behind some of these retrospective patterns. Also, much lower than expected NMFS survey biomass during 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 results in lower biomass estimates in recent years. The biases for total abundance are much smaller than mature male biomass. As other model explorations are tackled retrospective patterns will be considered. 
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from September 2021):** 

*“When projecting the stock to determine whether it is approaching an overfished condition, identify the uncertainties included and ignored in the projection. It is particularly important to distinguish those that are captured in the projection (i.e. those associated with the model) and the additional uncertainties that form the basis for the ABC buffer.”*

Response: Uncertainties are discussed in the projection section included in the final SAFE in Sept. 2023.

*“When projecting MMB, label figures with the date to which it is projected (e.g., Feb. 15, 2022), not just the year (which can lead to confusion).”*

Response: Working on following this recommendation as we improve plotting standardization from GMACS output.

*“Consider a model in which the data starts in 1985 (as suggested by the CIE reviewers).”*

Response: Model 22.0 start in 1985, and was presented in May 2022, May 2023, and Sept 2023. After discussions during the 2023/24 CPT meetings the author is uncertain whether removing the early part of the time series is appropriate. Therefore the model will not be presented again unless specifically requested.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2022):** 

*"The CPT recommended examining how the initial conditions of abundance are treated as a future analysis"*

Response: This has not yet been addressed, but is on the list for future work. 
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2023 / Sept 2023):** 

*Reconsider which growth parameters are estimated vs. specified. Consider a model run with growth specified outside the model (CPT Sept 2023)*

Response: The author is collaborating with biologists on the availability of more recent growth data, and investigating the feasibility of recovering the original raw data used in the current growth specifications. Work in underway to determine the best path forward for growth parameterizations for this stock. 

*Survey selectivity / q / catchability. Reconsider the strong prior and shape of the selectivity curve. Consider using the BSFRF data as a prior on selectivity/catchability as was done in the snow crab assessment (CPT and SSC May/June 2023 and Sept/Oct 2023)*

Response: Models presented here (24.0 and 24.0b) reflect explorations on using the BSFRF data as a prior on selectivity - similar to snow crab (fall 2023). Further explorations on priors and shape have not been explored yet, initial model runs were performed on some of these between 2020 and 2022 by the previous assessment authors.

*Revisit blocking on molting probability from tagging data (CPT and SSC May/June 2023)*

Response: The blocking of molt probability for males reflects known change in the Bristol Bay ecosystem in the early 80s and have been a historic component of the current model. Models (24.0c and 24.0d) reflect removing this blocking to estimate one molting probability for the entire time series. 

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}


\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from June 2021):**

*“The SSC supports exploring more modern methods for estimating natural mortality, but notes that this method still relies strongly on the maximum age for BBRKC. The SSC recommends continued research to validate the ages for this stock.”*

Response: We agree with this suggestion. The maximum age was determined by old tagging data, and due to funding and personnel constraint, age validation for BBRKC is more likely a long-term goal than a short-term project.

*“The likelihood profile suggests that the values of M for male and female might be similar and that the current difference may be because of the constraint of base M to a low value. When M is misspecified, it can be the cause of a strong positive retrospective pattern, which BBRKC has. The SSC would have liked to have seen compositional fits and a retrospective analysis for model 19.6 or some model with a higher M value, particularly to see if it fits the plus group better. Despite the increase in F35%, there was not a commensurate increase in OFL. An exploration of the underlying reasons for this outcome is needed.”*

Response: Based on our past modelling experience, when M values for males and females are estimated separately, estimated M values tended to be always higher for females than for males. The likelihood profile was created through fixing M values for males and estimating M values for females, and when the fixed M values for males were very high, estimated M values for females tended to be similar to M values for males. The increase in F35% but not a commensurate increase in OFL is due to reduction of mature male biomass caused by the high M. 

As a reference, we copied the likelihood profile computed in May 2020 below. Model 19.6 uses male base M of 0.257 estimated by Then et al. (2015), and the likelihood profile of base M from 0.1 to 0.4 is as follow:

```{r Mprofile, fig.cap = "Likelihood profile on M from May 2020 and 2021, current values of M are circled on the profile."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/likelihood profile M_2020.png", dpi = 125)
```

It appears that the maximum likelihood value is achieved with a base M of 0.31 for males and 0.321 for females.

In May 2023, models 23.0, 23.0a, 23.0b, and 23.3 all involve variations of higher base M values for males. Higher base M values do not appear to improve the plus group fittings. In Sept 2023 the accepted model was 23.0a which estimates M for males with a tight prior. This was an increased from previous fixed values of 0.18 and is thought to be more appropriate for king cra stocks.  

*“In addition to the CPT recommended models (19.3d, 19.3e, and 19.3g), the SSC recommends a simplified version of model 19.3d that estimates one natural mortality parameter across sex and time, and one shared catchability and selectivity curve for the NMFS trawl survey to help make several selectivity parameters better defined.”*

Response: We named this as model 21.0 and included it in the September 2021 assessment.

*“The SSC requests that the current crab management zones be included in the maps of VAST model-derived spatial distributions of BBRKC.”*

Response: We will ask Dr. Jon Richar to add the current crab management zones to the VAST spatial plots.

*“The SSC also looks forward to the summary report from the March 2021 CIE Review for this stock.”*

Response: The summary report of the 2021 CIE review is included in Appendix D of the 2022 full SAFE (referenced on the NPFMC website).

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2021):**

*“The SSC requests that in addition to temperature effects on the timing of the molt-mate cycle, the authors explore other potential drivers (e.g., prey quality or quantity) that could underlie the incomplete molt-mate cycle observed in 2021. Based on NMFS trawl survey female biomass estimates, the State of Alaska closed the BBRKC fishery. Next year’s assessment should estimate the probability that the stock is currently in the overfished condition.”*

Response: NMFS staff did an evaluation of re-tow survey protocol in Spring 2022, no changes were adopted at that time. Probabilities in the overfished condition for some models were estimated in September 2021, May 2022, and for the base model in September 2022. Model 23.2 was presented in May 2023, as an exploration of the base model (21.1b) without the retow data for females. This model does not drastically affect the federal harvest control rules, but does estimate a lower biomass for females which would directly affect the State harvest strategy.   

*“The SSC recommends that authors should carefully consider assessment implications of the stock boundaries given the evidence of crabs outside of the managed area. The SSC suggests that the authors should still be able to use data from outside stock boundaries, even if not used in the input survey abundance estimates. For example, the abundance seen outside stock boundaries could be treated as covariate informing catchability within the model. This analysis seems particularly important for females that are increasingly outside of the current stock boundaries and are at low abundance, triggering the State closure. The SSC recommends that the authors formulate separate survey abundance time series inside and outside of the defined area that could prove useful in the assessment model (e.g., informing catchability). If this is not an option in the stock assessment, then it highlights the need for ESRs or ESPs to track movement of these crabs both through survey results and developing indices from local knowledge.”* 

Response: The current version of GMACS seems not to be able to use the Northern RKC survey index to inform BBRKC survey catchability. We tried to add a model to include both BBRKC and Northern RKC data, but the groundfish fisheries bycatch is not currently available in the Northern area. In the last two full SAFEs - September 2022 and 2023 - we plotted more proportional data of the Northern RKC. Overall, the proportions of different size groups of the Northern RKC during a recent dozen years are higher than in the past and do not trend higher except for mature females in 2021. The high survey mature female abundance in the Northern area in 2021 was primarily from three tows and one of them is more than 50% of total mature females. The survey abundance of the Northern RKC will continue to be plotted in the SAFE report in the future. After migration patterns between BBRKC and the Northern RKC are fully understood, we will model them in the stock assessment.    

*“The SSC supports the BSFRF collaborative work with ADF&G and NMFS to tag BBRKC.”*

Response: We fully support tagging efforts, especially those to understand seasonal movement and the flow of individuals in or out of the Bristol Bay management area.

*“It would be useful to investigate if there is a mechanism for higher natural mortality or fishing mortality for females only during that early time period while following the CPT recommendation of looking at model 21.0 with constant but separate Ms by sex. Since Model 21.0 estimates a very high level of fishing mortality, but does seem to account for the decline in large females, there may be a fishery selectivity issue in that period. If the modelers choose not to continue to use historic data prior to 1985, this suggestion may not be useful.”*

Response: Figuring out the exact causes of high mortality in the early 1980s is always difficult and we summarize the potential causes in Appendix A of the last full SAFE, section C-vi, “Potential Reasons for High Mortality during the Early 1980s”. The directed fishery does not catch many large females and small crab, so it is difficult to remove these crab from the fishery. If this period of high natural mortality was a concern, it would be preferred to start the model in 1985, which has two advantages: avoiding the early 1980s period so that a constant M over time can be used, and the same NMFS survey gear throughout the whole model time period.     

*“The SSC supports continued exploration of the use of VAST estimates for this assessment, particularly if their use will inform mechanisms underlying shifting distributions outside of the current management area.”*

Response: We also support improvement of VAST estimates and are willing to provide feedback to Jon for further improvement. In general the CPT has not prioritized using VAST output in crab models, we hope to revisit this soon, potentially at the Jan 2025 modeling workshop.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from June 2022):**

*The SSC noted that during preliminary model runs in May, a full document need not be produced, but one that focuses a summary of model features and runs would be sufficient.*

Response: Starting in May 2023 the proposed model run document reflects these changes, focusing on model runs and explorations. Model structure and historical information is linked to via the NPFMC website in the summary section and not repeated in this document. The author welcomes further suggestions on the "proposed model" run documents since the CPT does not formally have a format for these.

*"The SSC recommends exploring how to estimate both catchabilities (NMFS trawl survey and BSFRF survey), but with a linked prior to influence them to scale together (i.e., assume some approximate value of how much higher q is for that survey)."*

Response: This is on the authors list of future work to be addressed with explorations of catchability for both surveys, but has not yet been explored in this document.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2022):**

*"The SSC recommends that a high priority be placed on trying to isolate factors that reduce the retrospective bias in mature male biomass."*

Response: The author agrees that this should be a high priority, however current explorations are still ongoing.  

*"The SSC recommends investigation of the highly biased fits to the BSFRF index and suggests that the current approach of inflating the variance to account for lack of fit is inappropriate when obvious bias is present."*

Response: We agree with this recommendation, and are investigating this avenue along with exploring catchability for both surveys. One method to account for this is to use the BSFRF survey to inform a prior on NMFS q and not have it fit directly in the model (Models. 24.0a and 24.0b in this document).

*"The accumulation of large males and particularly large females in the plus group indicates length bin groups may need to be re-evaluated."*

Response: We acknowledge this observation and have extending the size bins on the list of further work for this model. This was not prioritized on this cycle but continues to be on the list.

*"The SSC noted that the NMFS and the State determined that the survey re-tows would not be conducted in 2022, despite meeting the threshold to do so. The SSC requests an examination from the assessment author of the potential value of these re-tows, and whether re-tows provide a more or less accurate index of abundance."*

Response: Model 23.2 was explored in May of 2023 as a bookend for the model output without any retow data. If the CPT and SSC wish to see more variations of this model we can provide them, i.e. removing some years and not all as one possibility. While female re-tow data does not highly affect male model outcomes it does affect fishery closures since the State of Alaska harvest strategy uses a mature female threshold for opening.

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2023):**

*Provide basis for the tight prior on M and catchability.*

Response: The prior on trawl survey catchability is estimated with a mean of 0.896 and a standard deviation of 0.025 (CV about 0.03) that is based on double-bag experiment results (Weinberg et al. 2004). The prior on M is based on the balance of allowing M to be estimated above the default, historic 0.18 value for males but realizing the limitations of the data to estimate M freely. Furture work is planned and will continue to explore the most appropriate estimation of M.

*Consider tracking Dungeness crab abundance in the EBS and how this might affect BBRKC dynamics.*

Response: Currently there is no abundance estimate of Dungeness crab in the EBS. Conversations have occurred between the author and regional biologist on possible general affects, with the overall consensus that these two species are likely not occupying the same habitat as juveniles/adults. However most of the early life spatial occupation for both of these stocks is unknown, so there may be competition for food in early life stages. Trends of Dungeness catch over time will be explored in future work.

*Explain why equal sample sizes are used for male and female size composition data.*

Response: The author is unsure of this historic part of the model, and is working on the reasoning and appropriateness. 

*MCMC output diagnostics, autocorrelation plots and parameter chains*

Response: These will be provided in Sept 2024 when a full MCMC is performed on the preferred models. 

*Possible effect of high 2011 recruitment as scene in survey size composition figures*

Response: Size composition plots in Sept 2023 highlighted a potential recruitment event in 2011 for both males and females from the NMFS survey data (Figures 6 and 7 - Sept 2023 SAFE). This peak occurs as size classes that are not included in the assessment model (< 65mm, figures 43 and 44 - Sept 2023 SAFE), therefore this recruitment likely plays little role in the model estimates and resulting retrospective pattern since it is not seen in subsequent years to be included in the model. 


# C. Modeling Approaches and Explorations for spring 2024{-}


## Assessment Methodology {-}

This assessment model uses the GMACS modeling framework (since 2019) and is detailed in Appendix A of the last full SAFE report (link in the summary section).
An updated version of GMACS (version 2.01.M.10, 2024-02-27) was used. The fall 2023 assessment used version 2.01.M.01, 2023-03-13. Progress of GMACS development has been documented on the GitHub development site ([link GMACS GitHub](https://github.com/GMACS-project?view_as=public)).

## Model explorations{-}
Model explored in this document:

  - **23.0a**:          base model (fall 2023), M for males estimated in the model + updated GMACS 
  - **23.0a (MMB season)**: base model + mmb estimated in last model time period
  - **21.1b**:          previous base model, M fixed = 0.18 for males + updated GMACS
  - **21.1b (MMB season)**: 21.1b + mmb estimated in last model time period
 
  - **24.0**:           23.0a (MMB season) + selectivity informed by BSFRF 
  - **24.0b**:          21.1b (MMB season) + selectivity informed by BSFRF 
  - **24.0c**:          23.0a (MMB season) + 1 molt period for males and females
  - **24.0d**:          21.1b (MMB season) + 1 molt period for males and females

### Reasoning for model explorations {-}
Six model scenarios are presented in this report. The first two models have nearly identical results and were compared to show the effect of estimating MMB at the beginning of the last season of the year, versus season 6 in previous versions. During some GMACS updating it was discovered that, due to the order of events that take place in a season within the model, the MMB for each year should be estimated in the last season - here season 7 instead of season 6. This is consistent with crab MMB to be estimated on Feb. 15th in each year. Small differences in the reference points are present with this update due to small changes in MMB, but overall model fit is nearly identical, including the MLE and likelihood components (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components) and \@ref(tab:likelihood-components2)). **update**

The rest of the model scenarios can be divided into two areas of exploration: 1) exploring a prior on selectivity using the BSFRF data similar to snow crab models in 2023 (models 24.0 and 24.0b) and 2) simplification of molting probabilities to one time period instead of two (models 24.0c and 24.0d). 


Exploring natural mortality has been a repeated theme in this model, with explorations being performed the last few years during spring model scenarios. The models runs here build on those explorations. They include two models with higher fixed base M for males - one at 0.257, which is the estimate of natural mortality based on Then et al. (2015) and is documented in May 2021 proposed runs with a max age of 25, and one at 0.31, which is the estimate of natural mortality for males based on a likelihood profile performed in 2020 (graphical output is included in the SSC/CPT comment responses). Additionally, a model was run that included estimating the base M for males using a log-normal prior with a mean of 0.18 and a CV of 0.04.

Both the recent years CPT/SSC comments and the simpler modeling workshop report suggested that further work be done to determine the most appropriate method to estimate catchability (*Q*) for the NMFS trawl survey. Currently, initial trawl survey catchability is estimated to be 0.896 with a standard deviation of 0.025 (CV about 0.03) that is based on double-bag experiment results (Weinberg et al. 2004). However, the appropriateness of this prior and the relationship between NMFS trawl survey *Q* and that assumed for the BSFRF survey should be explored further. The models presented here are just a beginning of this exploration since they assume the same prior distribution mean but increase the variability to a CV of 0.06. 

 

## Results {-}


### a. Sensitivity to new GMACS versions {-}
Models 21.1b and 21.1b (update) reflect sensitivities of the model to updates in GMACS. The likelihoods for these two models are identical (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components)). However, there are slight differences in terminal year MMB, B~35%~, and resulting F~ofl~ and specifications (Table \@ref(tab:specs)). The estimated F~35%~ is the same for both models.


### b. Effective sample sizes and weighting factors {-}
- CVs are assumed to be 0.03 for retained catch biomass, 0.04 for total male biomass, 0.07 for pot bycatch biomasses, 0.10 for groundfish bycatch biomasses, and 0.23 for recruitment sex ratio. Models also estimate sigmaR for recruitment variation and have a penalty on M variation and many prior-densities.     
- Initial trawl survey catchability (Q) is estimated to be 0.896 with a standard deviation of 0.025 (CV about 0.03) based on the double-bag experiment results (Weinberg et al. 2004). These values are used to set a prior for estimating Q in all models, except models 23.1a and 23.3 which the same distribution with a CV of 0.06.


### b. Tables of estimates {-}
- Negative log-likelihood values are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:likelihood-components) -- \@ref(tab:likelihood-components3) for all models, while parameter estimates are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:parm-std211b) -- \@ref(tab:parm-std22)  for a few respesentative models.
- Natural mortality estimates are shown in Table \@ref(tab:Natmort).
- Abundance, MMB, and recruitment time series for a few representative models are found in Tables \@ref(tab:est-m211b) -- \@ref(tab:est-m232). 

### c. Evaluation of the fit to the data and model estimates.{-}
- Selectivities by length (Figures \@ref(fig:sel1), \@ref(fig:sel2), and \@ref(fig:sel3))

One of the most important results is estimated trawl survey selectivity. Survey selectivity affects not only the fitting of the data but also the absolute abundance estimates. These estimated survey selectivities are generally smaller than the capture probabilities in Figure A1 (refer to last full SAFE draft) because survey selectivities include capture probabilities and crab availability. The NMFS survey catchability (*Q*) is estimated to be 0.896 from the trawl experiment. The reliability of estimated survey selectivities will greatly affect the application of the model to fisheries management. Under- or over-estimates of survey selectivities will cause a systematic upward or downward bias of abundance estimates, respectively. Information about crab availability in the survey area at survey times will help estimate the survey selectivities. Higher estimated natural mortalities generally result in lower NMFS survey selectivities, while the estimated survey selectivities after 1981 are similar among the models. Those models with a higher CV on the prior distribution of *Q* for the NMFS survey both estimated a value above 1.

- Molting probability by length (Figures \@ref(fig:molt1), \@ref(fig:molt2), and \@ref(fig:molt3))

For all models, estimated molting probabilities during 1975-2022 are generally lower than those estimated from the 1954-1961 and 1966-1969 tagging data (Balsiger 1974, Figure 9a and 9b in the last full SAFE). Lower molting probabilities mean more oldshell crab, possibly due to changes in molting probabilities over time or shell aging errors. Overestimates or underestimates of oldshell crab will result in lower or higher estimates of male molting probabilities.

- NMFS trawl survey biomass and BSFRF surveys (Figures \@ref(fig:surv1) -- \@ref(fig:surv2d)).

The survey male biomass estimates in 2022 are slightly higher than those in 2018, 2019, and 2021, but the survey female biomass estimates are lower than 2018 and 2019, and up slightly from 2021. Estimated population biomass increased dramatically in the mid-1970s then decreased precipitously in the early 1980s. Estimated biomass had increased during 1985-2003 for males and during 1985-2007 for females, then declined, and have steadily declined since the late 2000s.  

Among the model scenarios, model estimated relative NMFS survey biomasses are similar, with some changed in scale due to changes in M and *Q* which is expected. All models fit the catch and bycatch biomasses very well and similarly so they are not presented in this document. Residuals of survey biomasses did not show any consistent patterns for all models (Figures \@ref(fig:surv1-res) and \@ref(fig:surv1-resM)).   

The fit to BSFRF survey data are similar among the models, with some variability in scale due to changes in M and trawl survey *Q*, however these are expected due to the large additional CV placed on these data.

- Recruitment (Figures \@ref(fig:rect1), \@ref(fig:rect2), and \@ref(fig:rect3))

Recruitment time series are plotted for all model scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:rect1)), and also in groups of like models. Recruitment is estimated at the end of year in GMACS and is moved up one year for the beginning of next year. Estimated recruitment time series are generally similar in trends for all models, with those models with higher M values having generally higher recruitment. Like the results of previous models, the terminal year recruitment analysis with model 21.1b suggests the estimated recruitment in the last year should not be used for estimating B~35%~ (2022 BBRKC SAFE).  

- Fishing mortality (Figure \@ref(fig:fmort))

The average of estimated male recruits from 1984 to 2021 for models starting in 1975 and from 1986 to 2021 for models starting in 1985 (Figure 12a) and mature male biomass per recruit are used to estimate B35%. The full fishing mortalities for the directed pot fishery at the time of fishing are plotted against mature male biomass on Feb. 15 in the last full SAFE (See BBRKC 2022 SAFE link and Figures 13a, 13.b and 13c). Estimated fishing mortalities in most years before the current harvest strategy was adopted in 1996 were above F35%. Under the current harvest strategy, estimated fishing mortalities were at or above the F35% limits in 1998-1999, 2005, 2007-2010, and 2014-2019 for models 21.1b, but below the F35% limits in the other post-1995 years. 
For model 21.1b, estimated full pot fishing mortalities ranged from 0.00 to 2.27 during 1975-2020, with estimated values over 0.40 during 1975-1982, 1984-1987, 1990-1991, 1993, 1998 and 2007-2009 (Figure \@ref(fig:fmort)). 
Estimated fishing mortalities for pot female and groundfish fisheries bycatches are generally small and less than 0.07. 

- Estimated mature male biomsss (Figures \@ref(fig:mmb1), \@ref(fig:mmb2), and \@ref(fig:mmb3))

Estimated mature male biomass for all models have a similar trend over time, however the scaling of the biomass is highly dependent, as expected, on estimates of natural mortality (M) and *Q* in the model. Overall, higher estimates of M for males produce larger estimates of mature male biomass for most of the time series. Recent mature male biomass, in the last five years or so, was relatively similar for all models except model 23.1 with the increase in estimated NMFS *Q*. Model 23.3, which estimates M for males and has a larger CV on the *Q* prior, produced similar results to the base model, with the except of the last five years (Figure \@ref(fig:mmb2)). All models were compared to model 22.0 in Figure \@ref(fig:mmb3), which allows for a closer look at the more recent time frame since this plot starts in 1985.

- Size composition fits by length and residual bubble plots (Figures  \@ref(fig:sc-pot) -- \@ref(fig:sc-res-M4)).

All models fit the length composition data similarly and well. Modal progressions are tracked well in the trawl survey data, particularly beginning in mid-1990s. Cohorts first seen in the trawl survey data in 1975, 1986, 1990, 1995, 1999, 2002 and 2005 can be tracked over time. Bycatch size composition data provide little information to track modal progression and is not displayed graphically.
Residuals of proportions of length are plotted to examine their patterns. Residuals were calculated as observed minus predicted and standardized by the estimated standard deviation. Generally, residuals of proportions of survey males and females appear to be random over length and year for all models, however models with higher base M - models 23.0 and 23.0b - improve the plus group fittings slightly.   

### d. Retrospective and historical analyses {-}
Retrospective analysis was performed for a selection of models - 21.1b, 22.0, 23.0a, and 23.3 - to represent the base model and determine if the retrospective pattern is reduced by estimating M (model 23.0a), or estimating M and relaxing the prior on *Q* (model 23.3) (Figures \@ref(fig:retro211b) -- \@ref(fig:retro233)). Retrospective analysis were performed using the GMACS retrospective feature which runs the current years model (2022) and sequentially excludes one year of data to evaluate current model performance in hindcast. 

The retrospective pattern for MMB did improve with estimation of M for males, as reported in the Mohn's rho values on Figures \@ref(fig:retro230a) and \@ref(fig:retro233), from a Mohn's rho of 0.373 to 0.226. While overall model fit was not improved with estimate of M for males (see likelihood tables) the improved retrospective pattern in MMB maybe a reason to consider this model for specifications in the fall.  The base model (21.1b) has a fairly larger retrospective pattern (Mohn's rho = 0.373), and this pattern is increased in model 22.0. The source of the increased retrospective pattern in model 22.0 is one of the hesitations of adopting this reduced data version of model 21.1b for specifications. Further work is needed to understand this increased pattern. 

### e. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.{-}
- Estimated standard deviation of parameters are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:parm-std211b) -- \@ref(tab:parm-std22) for a few respesentative models.

- The last completed SAFE document in 2022 details uncertainty estimates in the current base model parameterization in further detail (link here: [BBRKC 2022 SAFE](https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=b98b90b2-88ab-43c2-9487-c12cdb4e0a25.pdf&fileName=BBRKC%20SAFE%202022%20Final.pdf)). 



### f. Comparison of alternative model scenarios.{-}
In this report (May 2023), nine models are compared. For negative likelihood value comparisons (Tables \@ref(tab:likelihood-components) and \@ref(tab:likelihood-components2)), none of the model runs improved the total likelihood over the base model (21.1b). The base model was run using the most recent updates to GMACS (version 2.01.M.01) and compared to output from the runs in September 2022. The likelihood components of these runs were identical out to three digits, however reference point differences, although small, do exist (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components)). The difference were determined to be minimal and this updated version of GMACS was used for the rest of the models runs in this report. The rest of the model scenarios are compared to this updated version of the base model 21.1b (update).

Model 22.0 represents the base model with a start date for the data of 1985 instead of 1975. This model was explored in both May 2022 and September 2022, and is presented here as an option to bring forward in September of 2023 if the reduction in data is appropriate. Concerns over the increased retrospective pattern in this model still exist (Figure \@ref(fig:retro22))

Four models (23.0, 23.0a, 23.0b, 23.3) either had higher base natural mortality (M) estimates for males or estimated M. Of these models the two that estimated male natural mortality had slightly better fits than those with higher fixed values, however none of these models improved fit over the base model (21.1b). All of these models increased natural mortality on both the male and female portions of the population, since female mortality is estimated as on offset of males (Table \@ref(tab:Natmort)). Increases in natural mortality produce models results that increase the scale of recruitment and mature male biomass, but had similar fits to survey data. Larger size classes did appear to fit better with higher natural mortality but this was not reflected in the overall fit to size compositions. Increasing natural mortality on males also leads to higher F~35%~ values and therefore larger F~OFL~ values. Based on the likelihood profile performed in 2020 (see CPT/SSC comments section Figure 1) it does appear that male natural mortality should be higher than the assumed 0.18 in the base model, however model explorations here did not reflect this improvement in total likelihood. While the author does acknowledge that natural mortality should be updated, determining the correct value or prior to estimate M is important due to the large ramifications on the references points. Future work on natural mortality could include repeating the likelihood profile from 2020, exploring the sensitivity to estimating M with different prior configurations and exploring the relationship between estimating M and *Q* simultaneously with less informative priors. 

Two models (23.1a and 23.3) evaluated increased variability (double the CV) on the very informative prior on *Q* for the NMFS trawl survey. Increasing the variability in the prior distribution resulted in a *Q* estimate >1 for both of these models (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components2)). Since the models assume the BSFRF survey catchability (*Q*) is 1.0, it is not realistic for the *Q* value for the NMFS survey to be greater than 1. The BSFRF survey uses small mesh sizes, the net footrope goes into mud, and the camera records the net footrope touching and leaving the sea bottom. Therefore, theoretically, it is reasonable to assume its catchability to be 1.0. Earlier model explorations in May 2022 suggested that, when it is allowed to be estimated, the BSFRF catchability is estimated to be greater than 1. Overall, more work is needed to fully address the need to explore *Q* estimation in this model and how it relates to the assumed catchability of 1.0 for the BSFRF survey. 
As discussed at the simpler modeling workshop in March 2023, further work is needed to explore the interplay between these two catchability estimates and to determine a prior on NMFS *Q* that would be less strict and more appropriate. 

Based on the above considerations, we recommend model continuing to use the base model (21.1b) for overfishing definition determination in September 2023 due to a simple approach: a fixed base M of 0.18 for males, less confounding between estimating M and survey catchability, and acceptable data fittings. Model 22.0 is also an option, however this reduced data version of the base model has a larger retrospective pattern for mature male biomass, suggesting some caution in transitioning to this version of the base model. We are open to bringing forward variations of models that increase natural mortality but do not have a preferred model at this time for that improvement.

# E. Projections and Future Outlook {-}
Projections into the future will be performed in the Sept. 2023 assessment with the models selected from this document.

The projections are subject to many uncertainties. Constant population parameters estimated in the models used for the projections include M, growth, and fishery selectivities. The uncertainty of abundance and biomass estimates in the terminal year also affects the projections. Uncertainties of the projections caused by these constant parameters and abundance estimates in the terminal year would be reduced by the 20% ABC buffer.  However, if an extreme event occurs, like a sharp increase of M during the projection period, the ABC buffer would be inadequate, and the projections might underestimate uncertainties. The largest uncertainty is likely from recruitment used for the projections. Higher or lower assumed recruitment would cause too optimistic or too pessimistic projections. Overall, recruitment and M used for projections are main factors for projection uncertainties.
