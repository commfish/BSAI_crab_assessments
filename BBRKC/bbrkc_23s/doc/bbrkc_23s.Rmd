# Summary {-}
The model explorations presented here include those suggested by CPT and SSC, and model sensitibity to GMACS updates. The model explorations can be divided into four areas of exploration: 1) starting the base model in 1985, which has been considering in prior years, 2) models to explore the base level of natural mortality for males, and 3) models to begin an exploration of q estimation for the NMFS trawl survey, and 4) exploration of model output without including the survey retow data for females in years where a retows were performed (1999, 2000, 2006 to 2012, 2017, and 2021).The models presented here are the beginning of work to explore these topics and the author acknowledges that further exploration is warranted. Additionally, an updated version of GMACS was used for these model exploration and model fit was similar with slight differences in reference point calculations with these updates. 

The results of these model explorations are presented in this document in section C. Background on the Bristol Bay red king crab modeling approach, modeling framework (GMACS), and history of the stock and fisheries can be found in the last full SAFE published on the NPFMC website and will not be repeated here.

# B. Responses to SSC and CPT  {-}

## CPT and SSC Comments on Assessments in General {-}
**Response to SSC Comments (June 2022, Oct 2022):**
*"The SSC recommends that the RKC authors work together to complete a stock structure template for June 2023."*

Response: A draft stock structure template for RKC in the Bering Sea will be presented at the May 2023 CPT meeting. 

*"The SSC suggests that the CPT develop guidelines for when to change model start dates"*

Response: This topic was taken up at the Jan 2023 CPT meeting, with some basic guidelines presented in those minutes that included keeping data unless there was a strong reason (environmental, poor data quality, model instability) to exclude the data and data exclusion did not lead to drastic model output changes. Model 22.0, where data starts in 1985 vs 1975, is presented in this document.

**Response to SSC Comments (from February 2022):**

*“The SSC supports the CPT general recommendations that all stock assessments include results from the currently accepted model with new data (base model) so that changes in model performance can be assessed. Values for management-related quantities for all models that may be recommended by the CPT or SSC should also be available.”* 

Response: We have followed these recommendations.  

## CPT and SSC Comments on BBRKC assessment {-}
**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2021):** 

*“The CPT was concerned that the ‘information’ content of the data with respect to natural mortality could be related to strong assumptions elsewhere in the model, and recommended further exploration of natural mortality after September and suggested attending the June 2021 CAPAM workshop on natural mortality, which may provide some insights into best practices. A large increase in estimated natural mortality would likely increase fishing mortality reference points, with management implications.”*

Response: Model runs in May 2022 addressed some variations on M. Estimated M values in the length-based crab models tend to have higher values than the other approaches, and confounding among estimated M, survey selectivity/catchability, and recruitment in a length-based model makes it difficult to accurately estimate M in the model. Among the models presented here four address variations in M for males, including higher fixed M values and estimated M for males.

*“The CPT was interested in more exploration of the retrospective patterns, which seem to have increased since the last assessment despite no new data being added. Reported Mohn’s rhos were starting to reach concerning magnitudes in the proposed models?”*

Response: The catch and bycatch updates in May 2022 made the retrospective patterns slightly worse than before. Higher than expected BSFRF survey biomass during 2007-2008 and 2013-2016 and NMFS survey biomass in 2014 likely caused these biases. Also, much lower than expected NMFS survey biomass during 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 results in lower biomass estimates in recent years. The biases for total abundance are much smaller than mature male biomass. Explorations further, since May 2022, on retrospective patterns are underway but not presented here. 
 
**Response to CPT Comments (from September 2021):** 

*“When projecting the stock to determine whether it is approaching an overfished condition, identify the uncertainties included and ignored in the projection. It is particularly important to distinguish those that are captured in the projection (i.e. those associated with the model) and the additional uncertainties that form the basis for the ABC buffer.”*

Response: Uncertainties are discussed in the projection section here and will be included in the final SAFE in Sept. 2023.

*“When projecting MMB, label figures with the date to which it is projected (e.g., Feb. 15, 2022), not just the year (which can lead to confusion).”*

Response: We followed this recommendation.

*“Consider a model in which the data starts in 1985 (as suggested by the CIE reviewers).”*

Response: Model 22.0 start in 1985, and was presented in May 2022, Sept 2023, and in this document. After discussions during the Jan/Feb council cycle the author is uncertain whether removing the early part of the time series is appropriate. However, this model is presented here as an option.

**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2022):** 
*"The CPT recommended examining how the initial conditions of abundance are treated as a future analysis"*

Response: This has not yet been address, but is on the list for future work.

**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from June 2021):**

*“The SSC supports exploring more modern methods for estimating natural mortality, but notes that this method still relies strongly on the maximum age for BBRKC. The SSC recommends continued research to validate the ages for this stock.”*

Response: We agree with this suggestion. The maximum age was determined by old tagging data, and due to funding and personnel constraint, age validation for BBRKC is more like a long-term goal than a short-term project.

*“The likelihood profile suggests that the values of M for male and female might be similar and that the current difference may be because of the constraint of base M to a low value. When M is misspecified, it can be the cause of a strong positive retrospective pattern, which BBRKC has. The SSC would have liked to have seen compositional fits and a retrospective analysis for model 19.6 or some model with a higher M value, particularly to see if it fits the plus group better. Despite the increase in F35%, there was not a commensurate increase in OFL. An exploration of the underlying reasons for this outcome is needed.”*

Response: Based on our past modelling experience, when M values for males and females are estimated separately, estimated M values tended to be always higher for females than for males. The likelihood profile was created through fixing M values for males and estimating M values for females, and when the fixed M values for males were very high, estimated M values for females tended to be similar to M values for males. The increase in F35% but not a commensurate increase in OFL is due to reduction of mature male biomass caused by the high M. 

As a reference, we copied the likelihood profile computed in May 2020 below. Model 19.6 uses male base M of 0.257 estimated by Then et al. (2015), and the likelihood profile of base M from 0.1 to 0.4 is as follow:

```{r Mprofile, fig.cap = "Distribution of blue king crab (\\textit{Paralithodes platypus}) in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Aleutian Islands waters (shown in blue)."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/likelihood profile M_2020.png", dpi = 125)
```

It appears that the maximum likelihood value is achieved with a base M of 0.31 for males and 0.321 for females.

In May 2023, models 23.0, 23.0a, 23.0b, and 23.3 all involve variations of higher base M values for males. Higher base M values do not appear to improve the plus group fittings.  

*“In addition to the CPT recommended models (19.3d, 19.3e, and 19.3g), the SSC recommends a simplified version of model 19.3d that estimates one natural mortality parameter across sex and time, and one shared catchability and selectivity curve for the NMFS trawl survey to help make several selectivity parameters better defined.”*

Response: We named this as model 21.0 and included it in the September 2021 assessment.

*“The SSC requests that the current crab management zones be included in the maps of VAST model-derived spatial distributions of BBRKC.”*

Response: We will ask Dr. Jon Richar to add the current crab management zones to the VAST spatial plots.

*“The SSC also looks forward to the summary report from the March 2021 CIE Review for this stock.”*

Response: The summary report of the 2021 CIE review is included in Appendix D of the last full SAFE (see link in summary above).

**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2021):**

*“The SSC requests that in addition to temperature effects on the timing of the molt-mate cycle, the authors explore other potential drivers (e.g., prey quality or quantity) that could underlie the incomplete molt-mate cycle observed in 2021. Based on NMFS trawl survey female biomass estimates, the State of Alaska closed the BBRKC fishery. Next year’s assessment should estimate the probability that the stock is currently in the overfished condition.”*

Response: NMFS staff did an evaluation of re-tow survey protocol in Spring 2022, no changes were adopted at that time. Probabilities in the overfished condition for some models were estimated in September 2021, May 2022, and for the base model in September 2022. Model 23.2 in presented here, in May 2023, was an exploration of the base model (21.1b) without the retow data for females. This model does not drastically affect the federal harvest control rules, but does estimate a lower biomass for females which would directly affect the State harvest strategy.   

*“The SSC recommends that authors should carefully consider assessment implications of the stock boundaries given the evidence of crabs outside of the managed area. The SSC suggests that the authors should still be able to use data from outside stock boundaries, even if not used in the input survey abundance estimates. For example, the abundance seen outside stock boundaries could be treated as covariate informing catchability within the model. This analysis seems particularly important for females that are increasingly outside of the current stock boundaries and are at low abundance, triggering the State closure. The SSC recommends that the authors formulate separate survey abundance time series inside and outside of the defined area that could prove useful in the assessment model (e.g., informing catchability). If this is not an option in the stock assessment, then it highlights the need for ESRs or ESPs to track movement of these crabs both through survey results and developing indices from local knowledge.”* 

Response: The current version of GMACS seems not to be able to use the Northern RKC survey index to inform BBRKC survey catchability. We tried to add a model to include both BBRKC and Northern RKC data, but the groundfish fisheries bycatch is not currently available in the Northern area. IN the last full SAFE - September 2022 - we plotted more proportional data of the Northern RKC in Figures 35a and 35b. Overall, the proportions of different size groups of the Northern RKC during a recent dozen years are higher than in the past and do not trend higher except for mature females in 2021. The high survey mature female abundance in the Northern area in 2021 was primarily from three tows and one of them is more than 50% of total mature females. The survey abundance of the Northern RKC will continue to be plotted in the SAFE report in the future. After migration patterns between BBRKC and the Northern RKC are fully understood, we will model them in the stock assessment.    

*“The SSC supports the BSFRF collaborative work with ADF&G and NMFS to tag BBRKC.”*

Response: We fully support tagging efforts, especially those to understand seasonal movement and the flow of individuals in or out of the Bristol Bay management area.

*“It would be useful to investigate if there is a mechanism for higher natural mortality or fishing mortality for females only during that early time period while following the CPT recommendation of looking at model 21.0 with constant but separate Ms by sex. Since Model 21.0 estimates a very high level of fishing mortality, but does seem to account for the decline in large females, there may be a fishery selectivity issue in that period. If the modelers choose not to continue to use historic data prior to 1985, this suggestion may not be useful.”*

Response: Figuring out the exact causes of high mortality in the early 1980s is always difficult and we summarize the potential causes in Appendix A of the last full SAFE, section C-vi, “Potential Reasons for High Mortality during the Early 1980s”. The directed fishery does not catch many large females and small crab, so it is difficult to remove these crab from the fishery. If this period of high natural mortality was a concern, it would be preferred to start the model in 1985, which has two advantages: avoiding the early 1980s period so that a constant M over time can be used, and the same NMFS survey gear throughout the whole model time period.     

*“The SSC supports continued exploration of the use of VAST estimates for this assessment, particularly if their use will inform mechanisms underlying shifting distributions outside of the current management area.”*

Response: We also support improvement of VAST estimates and are willing to provide feedback to Jon for further improvement. In general the CPT has not prioritized using VAST output in crab models, we hope to revist this soon.

**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from June 2022):**
*"The SSC recommends exploring how to estimate both catchabilities (NMFS trawl survey and BSFRF survey), but with a linked prior to influence them to scale together (i.e., assume some approximate value of how much higher q is for that survey)."*

Response: This is on the authors list of future work to be addressed with explorations of catchability for both surveys, but has not yet been explored in this document.

**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2022):**
*"The SSC recommends that a high priority be placed on trying to isolate factors that reduce the retrospective bias in mature male biomass."*
Response: The author agrees that this should be a high priority, however current explorations are still ongoing.  


# C. Modeling Approaches and Explorations for spring 2023{-}


## Assessment Methodology {-}

This assessment model again uses the modeling framework GMACS and is detailed in Appendix A of the last full SAFE report (link in the summary section).
An updated version of GMACS (version 2.01.M.01, 2023-03-13) was used. The fall 2022 assessment used version 2.01.F (2022-04-16). Progress of GMACS development has been documented on the GitHub development site [GMACS GitHub](https://github.com/GMACS-project?view_as=public)).

## Model explorations{-}
Model explored in this document:

  - 21.1b: base model, accepted for specifications in Fall 2022
  - 21.1b (update): base model + updated GMACS version
  - 22.0: 21.1b model with data after 1985 instead of 1975
  - 23.0: 21.1b + "base" M value for males fixed at M=0.257 (based on Then et al. 2015)
  - 23.0a: 21.1b + "base" M value for males estimated in the model (prior information)
  - 23.0b: 21.1b + "base" M value for males fixed at M=0.31 (best estimate based on 2020 likelihood profile work)
  - 23.1a: Double CV on NMFS q prior
  - 23.2: 21.1b with no retow data for females from the NMFS trawl survey
  - 23.3: 23.1a (base M for males estimated) + 23.1a (double CV on NMFS q prior)

### Reasoning for model explorations and other explorations not in this document {-}
Nine model scenarios are presented in this report. The first two models have very close results and were compared to determine the sensitivity of the base model to GMACS updates (version 2.01E vs version 2.01.M.01). Small difference in the reference points are present with this update but overall model fit is nearly identical, including the MLE and likelihood components (Table \@ref(tab:likeli)).

The rest of the model scenarios can be divided into four areas of exploration: 1) starting the base model in 1985, which has been considering in prior years (model 22.0), 2) models to explore the base level of natural mortality for males (models 23.0, 23.0a, 23.0b, and 23.3), and 3) models to begin an exploration of q estimation for the NMFS trawl survey (23.1a and 23.3), and 4) exploration of a model (model 23.2) without including the survey retow data for females in years where a retows were performed (1999, 2000, 2006 to 2012, 2017, and 2021).

The model start date has been discussed in prior modeling scenarios, most specifically in spring of 2022, and was a suggestion from the latest CIE review. Beginning the model in 1985 has advantages which include: a fized base M value for males, avoiding the dramatic abundance declines of the early 1980s, and recruitment associated with the extremely large M is not including in the B~35%~ estimate. 

Exploring natural mortality has been a repeated theme in this model, with explorations being performed the last few years during spring model scenarios. The models runs here build on those explorations. They include two models with higher fixed base M for males - one at 0.257, which is the estimate of natural mortality based on Then et al. 2015, and one at 0.31, which is the estimate of natural mortality for males based on a likelihood profile performed in 2020 (graphical output is included in the SSC/CPT comment responses). Additional, a model was run that included estimating the base M for males using a log-normal prior with a mean of 0.18 and a CV of 0.04.

Both the recent years CPT/SSC comments and the simpler modeling workshop report suggested that further work be done to determine the most appropriate method to estimate catchability (*Q*) for the NMFS trawl survey. Currently, initial trawl survey catchability is estimated to be 0.896 with a standard deviation of 0.025 (CV about 0.03) that is based on double-bag experiment results (Weinberg et al. 2004). However, the appropriateness of this prior and the relationship between NMFS trawl survey *Q* and that assumed for the BSFRF survey should be explored further. The models presented here are just a beginning of this exploration since they assume the same prior distribution mean but increase the variability to a CV of 0.06. 

The last model scenario explored in this document is one to determine the sensitivity of model output to the female retow data being included in the modeling process. 

## Results {-}


### a. Sensitivity to new GMACS versions {-}
Models 21.1b and 21.1b(update) reflect sensitivities of the model to updates in GMACS. The likelihoods for these two models are identical (Table \@ref(tab:likeli)). However, there are slight differences in terminal year MMB, B~35%~, and resulting F~ofl~ and specifications (Table \@ref(tab:specs)). The estimated F~35%~ is the same for both models.
(Compare N matrix)

### b. Effective sample sizes and weighting factors {-}
- CVs are assumed to be 0.03 for retained catch biomass, 0.04 for total male biomass, 0.07 for pot bycatch biomasses, 0.10 for groundfish bycatch biomasses, and 0.23 for recruitment sex ratio. Models also estimate sigmaR for recruitment variation and have a penalty on M variation and many prior-densities.     
- Initial trawl survey catchability (Q) is estimated to be 0.896 with a standard deviation of 0.025 (CV about 0.03) based on the double-bag experiment results (Weinberg et al. 2004). These values are used to set a prior for estimating Q in all models, except models 23.1a and 23.3 which the same distribution with a CV of 0.06.
- Harmonic means of implied sample sizes and maximum caps of effective sample sizes for models 21.1b, 22.0, !!fix are summarized in Table 4.

### b. Tables of estimates {-}
- Negative log-likelihood values are summarized in Tables 5 for all models, while parameter estimates are summarized in Tables 6 for a few respesentative models.
- Natural mortality estimates are shown in Table \@ref(tab:Natmort).
- Abundance and biomass, and recruitment time series? 

### c. Evaluation of the fit to the data and model estimates.{-}
- Selectivities by length (Figures \@ref(fig:sel1), \@ref(fig:sel2), and \@ref(fig:sel3))

One of the most important results is estimated trawl survey selectivity. Survey selectivity affects not only the fitting of the data but also the absolute abundance estimates. These estimated survey selectivities are generally smaller than the capture probabilities in Figure A1 (refer to last full SAFE draft) because survey selectivities include capture probabilities and crab availability. The NMFS survey catchability is estimated to be 0.896 from the trawl experiment. The reliability of estimated survey selectivities will greatly affect the application of the model to fisheries management. Under- or over-estimates of survey selectivities will cause a systematic upward or downward bias of abundance estimates, respectively. Information about crab availability in the survey area at survey times will help estimate the survey selectivities. Higher estimated natural mortalities generally result in lower NMFS survey selectivities, while the estimated survey selectivities after 1981 are similar among the models. Those models with a higher CV on the prior distribution of *Q* for the NMFS survey both estimated a value above 1.

- Molting probability by length (Figures \@ref(fig:molt1), \@ref(fig:molt2), and \@ref(fig:molt3))

For all models, estimated molting probabilities during 1975-2022 are generally lower than those estimated from the 1954-1961 and 1966-1969 tagging data (Balsiger 1974). Lower molting probabilities mean more oldshell crab, possibly due to changes in molting probabilities over time or shell aging errors. Overestimates or underestimates of oldshell crab will result in lower or higher estimates of male molting probabilities.

- NMFS trawl survey biomass and BSFRF surveys (Figures \@ref(fig:surv1), \@ref(fig:surv1b), \@ref(fig:surv1c), \@ref(fig:surv1d), \@ref(fig:surv2), \@ref(fig:surv2b), \@ref(fig:surv2c), \@ref(fig:surv2d)).

The survey male biomass estimates in 2022 are slightly higher than those in 2018, 2019, and 2021, but the survey female biomass estimates are lower than 2018 and 2019, and up slightly from 2021. Estimated population biomass increased dramatically in the mid-1970s then decreased precipitously in the early 1980s. Estimated biomass had increased during 1985-2003 for males and during 1985-2007 for females, then declined, and have steadily declined since the late 2000s.  
Among the model scenarios, model estimated relative NMFS survey biomasses are similar, with some changed in scale due to changes in M and *Q* which is expected. All models fit the catch and bycatch biomasses very well and similarly so they are not presented in this document. 

The fit to BSFRF survey data are similar among the models, with some variability in scale due to changes in M and trawl survey *Q*, however these are expected due to the large additional CV placed on these data.

- Recruitment (Figures \@ref(fig:rec1), \@ref(fig:rec2), and \@ref(fig:rec3))

Recruitment time series are plotted for all model scenarios, and also in groups of like models. Recruitment is estimated at the end of year in GMACS and is moved up one year for the beginning of next year. Estimated recruitment time series are generally similar in trends for all models, with those models with higher M values having generally higher recruitment. Like the results of previous models, the terminal year recruitment analysis with model 21.1b suggests the estimated recruitment in the last year should not be used for estimating B~35%~.  

- fishing mortality rates

The average of estimated male recruits from 1984 to 2020 for models starting in 1975 and from 1986 to 2020 for models starting in 1985 (Figure 12a) and mature male biomass per recruit are used to estimate B35%. The full fishing mortalities for the directed pot fishery at the time of fishing are plotted against mature male biomass on Feb. 15 (Figures 13a, 13.b and 13c). Estimated fishing mortalities in most years before the current harvest strategy was adopted in 1996 were above F35% (Figures 13a and 13b). Under the current harvest strategy, estimated fishing mortalities were at or above the F35% limits in 1998-1999, 2005, 2007-2010, and 2014-2019 for models 21.1b and 22.1, but below the F35% limits in the other post-1995 years. 
For model 21.1b, estimated full pot fishing mortalities ranged from 0.00 to 2.27 during 1975-2020, with estimated values over 0.40 during 1975-1982, 1984-1987, 1990-1991, 1993, 1998 and 2007-2009 (Table 6a, Figure 13a). For model 22.1, estimated full pot fishing mortalities ranged from 0.00 to 2.37 during 1975-2020, with estimated values over 0.40 in the same years as model 21.1b. Estimated fishing mortalities for pot female and groundfish fisheries bycatches are generally small and less than 0.07. 
For model 21.1b, estimated M values are 0.89 during 1980-1984 and 0.18 for the other years for males, and 1.18 during 1980-1984 and 0.24 for the other years for females, with estimated female M values equaling to 1.325 times male M values (Figure 13c). For model 22.1, estimated M values are 0.88 during 1980-1984 and 0.18 for the other years for males, and 1.17 during 1980-1984 and 0.24 for the other years for females, with estimated female M values equaling to 1.327 times male M values. Biologically, females mature earlier than males and likely have higher M values. M values for nine models are listed in Table 7.  

- mmb
Absolute mature male biomasses for all models have a similar trend over time (Figures 11a and 11b).

- size comps - bubble plots and size comp figures

All models fit the fishery biomass data well and the survey biomass reasonably well (Figures 10 and 16). Because the model estimates annual fishing mortality for directed pot male catch, pot female bycatch, and trawl and fixed gear bycatch, the deviations of observed and predicted (estimated) fishery biomass are mainly due to size composition differences. Models 21.1, 21.1a, and 21.1b fit the NMFS area-swept biomass data almost identically (Figure 10a), and models 22.0e and 22.1a with a time block of high M during 2015-2018 fit the NMFS area-swept biomass data better than the other models.
All models also fit the length composition data well (Figures 18-24). Modal progressions are tracked well in the trawl survey data, particularly beginning in mid-1990s (Figures 18 and 19). Cohorts first seen in the trawl survey data in 1975, 1986, 1990, 1995, 1999, 2002 and 2005 can be tracked over time. Some cohorts can be tracked over time in the pot bycatch as well (Figure 21), but the bycatch data did not track the cohorts as well as the survey data. Groundfish bycatch data provide little information to track modal progression (Figures 23 and 24).
Residuals of survey biomasses and proportions of length are plotted to examine their patterns. Residuals were calculated as observed minus predicted and standardized by the estimated standard deviation. Residuals of survey biomasses did not show any consistent patterns for all models (Figures 17a-17f), although models 22.0e and 22.1a with a time block of high M during 2015-2018 have small absolute residuals during recent years.   Generally, residuals of proportions of survey males and females appear to be random over length and year for all models (Figures 25a-25e and 26a-26e). Models with higher base M values like models 22.0a and 22.0c improve the plus group fittings slightly.   

### d. Retrospective and historical analyses {-}
Retrospective analysis was performed for a selection of models - 21.1b, 22.0, 23.3.

### e. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.{-}

### f. Comparison of alternative model scenarios.{-}

Table 5a with likelihoods
similarities and differences 
- M models
- q models

In this report (May 2022), eleven models are compared. For negative likelihood value comparisons (Tables 5b and 5c), models 22.0c with high base M values and 22.1a with a time block of high M during 2015-2018 have the highest total likelihood values for models starting in 1985 and 1975, respectively, without the BSFRF survey data. High base M values estimated inside the models or additional time block of high M during 2015-2018 generally result in significantly higher total likelihood values. 

The first three models, 21.1, 21.1a, and 21.1b, have very close results. Model 21.1, the base model in 2021, was run with the updated GMACS version 2.01.E (finalized on Feb. 6, 2022), resulting in model 21.1a. The groundfish bycatch was updated when the AKFIN database was updated recently, resulting in model 21.1b.  The GMACS update and the groundfish fisheries bycatch update have hardly affected the results. Model 21.1b was used to compare the other eight new model scenarios. 
Among the new eight models, six models start in 1985 and were used to evaluate model starting year, BSFRF survey data, and one extra level of M during 2015-2018. Model 22.0 is the short data version of model 21.1b and the overall results are similar. The notable differences are smaller B35% (22,14 1 t vs 24,325 t) and NMFS survey catchability (0.93 vs 0.96), and higher MMB in the terminal year (2021) (15,507 t vs 15,118 t) and higher OFL (2,718 t vs 2,298 t) for model 22.0. These differences are probably caused by a high recruitment in 1984 (associated with the very M) being used for B35% computation for model 21.1b and more influence of BSFRF survey data for model 22.0. Estimating a base M for males for model 22.0a significantly increases likelihood values, slightly increases annual mature male biomass, and results in an estimated B35% about 10% lower than model 22.0.  A high M also results in higher F35% and OFL for model 22.0a. Contrasting with assuming catchability being 1.0 for the BSFRF survey, model 22.0b estimates it in the model. As expected, the results of model 22.0b are similar to model 22.0a because the extra variance in the model has greatly reduced the influence of BSFF survey catchability, even though the estimated catchability is 1.36. Model 22.0c drops the BSFRF survey data and results in better fits to the other data. The retrospective bias is greatly reduced with model 22.0c over model 22.0 (Mohn’s rho values from 0.376 to 0.235). The results of models 22.0b and 22.0c may indicate the problem of assuming catchability to be 1.0 for the BSFRF survey. With M=0.18 for males and without the BSFRF survey data, model 22.0d has very similar results with model 22.0, but with a smaller Mohn’s rho value (0.329 vs 0.376). Model 22.0e uses a similar approach to Model 21.2 in 2021 to address the survey abundance decline during recent years through adding a time block of M (2015-2018) and to reduce the retrospective bias. Mohn’s rho declines from 0.376 for model 22.0 to 0.135 for model 22.0e, and model 22.0e also fits the NMFS survey biomass much better during recent years. Model 22.0e results in overall higher mature male biomass estimates over time, higher B35% estimate, and lower mature male biomass estimate in the terminal year (2021).  
Relative to model 21.1b, model 22.1 drops the BSFRF data and model 22.1a adds a time block of M (2015-2018), similar to model 22.0e. Like the results of models starting in 1985, dropping the BSFRF data improve fits to the other data and reduces the retrospective bias. Combining no BSFRF data and a time block of M during 2015-2018 greatly reduces retrospective bias from Mohn’s rho of 0.347 for model 21.1b to 0.135 for model 22.1a.  
Based on the model results, it appears that the choice of preferred models depends on two factors: assumption of BSFRF survey catchability and estimation of M. The BSFRF survey uses small mesh sizes, the net footrope goes into mud, and the camera records the net footrope touching and leaving the sea bottom. Therefore, theoretically, it is reasonable to assume its catchability to be 1.0.   However, its small net opening and going into sea bottom could potentially cause herding effects, especially for long leg animals like red king crab. Parts of the lower bridles of survey nets could touch or close to sea bottom and herd or push crab into the net path. We talked to Scott Goodman about the herding effects of the BSFRF trawl survey a few years ago and it appears that the effects have not been evaluated. Model 22.0c estimated the catchability as 1.36, much higher than 1.0 assumed to the other models. Dropping the BSFRF data from the models does hardly impact the model results and reduces the model retrospective bias. Furthermore, if the BSFRF survey catchability is larger than 1.0 we assumed for the models, it could cause conservation concern. We suggest BSFRF evaluate the herding effects of the BSFRF trawl survey in the future if possible and eliminate the models that use the BSFRF survey data for time being. 
Considerations of M estimation are whether to estimate a base M for males for the whole time series or to add a time block during 2015-2018. Either of these two approaches reduces the retrospective bias considerably. Concern of estimating a base M for males for the whole time series is potential confounding with estimating trawl survey catchability. It is also hard to find good reasons to add a time block during 2015-2018 other than very old crab due to low recruitment for over a decade. Very old crab tend to have a higher M.     
Based on the above considerations, we recommend model 22.0d as the base model for overfishing definition determination in September 2022 due to a simple approach: a fixed base M of 0.18 for males, less confounding between estimating M and survey catchability, avoiding dramatic abundance decline during the early 1980s, no recruitment associated with an extremely high M being used for estimating B35%, and acceptable data fittings. Model 22.1 is a strong run-up and is a viable alternative. If estimating a base M value for males in the model is acceptable, then model 22.0c is also a good alternative, which fits the data well and greatly reduces retrospective bias from model 22.0. Values for management-related quantities for all models are summarized in likelihood Tables 5b, 5c, 5d, and 5e.

# E. Projections and Future Outlook
Projections into the future will be perfromed in the Sept. 2023 assessment with the models selected from this document.

The projections are subject to many uncertainties. Constant population parameters estimated in the models used for the projections include M, growth, and fishery selectivities. The uncertainty of abundance and biomass estimates in the terminal year also affects the projections. Uncertainties of the projections caused by these constant parameters and abundance estimates in the terminal year would be reduced by the 20% ABC buffer.  However, if an extreme event occurs, like a sharp increase of M during the projection period, the ABC buffer would be inadequate, and the projections might underestimate uncertainties. The largest uncertainty is likely from recruitment used for the projections. Higher or lower assumed recruitment would cause too optimistic or too pessimistic projections. Overall, recruitment and M used for projections are main factors for projection uncertainties.
