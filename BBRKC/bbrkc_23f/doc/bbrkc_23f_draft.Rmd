# Executive Summary {-}
1.	**Stock**: Red king crab (RKC), *Paralithodes camtschaticus*, in Bristol Bay, Alaska.

2.	**Catches**: The domestic RKC fishery began to expand in the late 1960s and peaked in 1980 with a catch of 129.95 million lb (58,943 t). The catch declined dramatically in the early 1980s and remained at low levels during the last three decades. After rationalization, catches were relatively high before the 2010/11 season but have been on a declining trend since 2014. The retained catch in 2020/21 was approximately 2.65 million lb (1,257 t), compared to 4.5 million lb (2,027 t) in 2018/19, following a reduction in total allowable catch (TAC). The magnitude of bycatch from groundfish trawl and fixed gear fisheries has been stable and small relative to stock abundance during the last 10 years. The decline of the directed pot fishery crab/pot lift (CPUE) has been much less than the retained catch decline, with the 2020/21 CPUE having about 12.5% reduction from the average CPUE during the recent 20 years. 

3.	**Stock biomass**: Estimated mature biomass increased dramatically in the mid-1970s, then decreased precipitously in the early 1980s. Estimated mature crab abundances increased during 1985-2007 with mature females being about four times more abundant in 2007 than in 1985 and mature males being about two times more abundant in 2007 than in 1985. Estimated mature abundance has steadily declined since 2007. The projected mature male biomass in 202X is approximately XX% of the estimate mean survey biomass for the entire time series. The estimated mature female biomass has also been very low during the last four years, with the 2022 values begin approximately XX42% of the mean. The estimated mature female abundance was below the state of Alaska harvest strategy threshold of 8.4 million of crab for a fishery opening in XX2022.

4.	**Recruitment**: Estimated recruitment was high during the 1970s and early 1980s and has generally been low since 1985 (1979-year class). During 1984-2020, estimated recruitment was above the historical average (1976-2019 reference years) only in 1984, 1986, 1990, 1995, 1999, 2002, and 2005. Estimated recruitment was extremely low during the last 12 years, and even lower during the recent eight years. With the low recruitment in recent years, the projected mature biomass is expected to decline during the next few years with a below-average fishing mortality of 0.167 to 0.25 $yr^{-1}$.

5.	**Management performance**:

The stock was above MSST in XX2021/22 (69% of BMSY) and hence was not overfished. Since total catch was below OFL, overfishing did not occur. The projection using the lowest recruitment periods during 2013-2021 would not likely result in “approaching an overfished condition” based on the current harvest strategy. The relatively low MSST in 2018/19 and B35% in 2019/20 below was caused by a problem of the previous GMACS version using the only sex ratio of recruitment in the terminal year for B35% computation in 2019. The lower estimated male recruitment ratio in the terminal year in 2019 resulted in a lower mean male recruitment for B35% computation.  The current version of GMACS uses an average of sex ratios of recruitment during the reference period to estimate B35%, which results in a stable sex ratio (about 50%) for the reference point calculation. 

The ABC buffer was increased from 10% to 20% in 2018, and an additional buffer of 5% was added in 2020 due to the lack of a 2020 survey. A 20% buffer was recommended by the CPT and SSC for ABC estimation for 2021/22. Reoccurring concerns for this stock are still present (cold pool distributional shifts, declining trends in mature biomass, lack of large recruitment pulses, retrospective patterns), in addition to low mature female biomass the last two years, all contribute to a recommended 20% buffer for 2022/23.

# B. Responses to SSC and CPT  {-}
## CPT and SSC Comments on Assessments in General {-}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments (June 2022, Oct 2022):**

*"The SSC recommends that the RKC authors work together to complete a stock structure template for June 2023."*

Response: A draft stock structure template for RKC in the Bering Sea will be presented at the May 2023 CPT meeting. 

*"The SSC suggests that the CPT develop guidelines for when to change model start dates"*

Response: This topic was taken up at the Jan 2023 CPT meeting, with some basic guidelines presented in those minutes that included keeping data unless there was a strong reason (environmental, poor data quality, model instability) to exclude the data and data exclusion did not lead to drastic model output changes. Model 22.0, where data starts in 1985 vs 1975, is presented in this document.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments (from February 2022):**

*“The SSC supports the CPT general recommendations that all stock assessments include results from the currently accepted model with new data (base model) so that changes in model performance can be assessed. Values for management-related quantities for all models that may be recommended by the CPT or SSC should also be available.”* 

Response: We have followed these recommendations.  

## CPT and SSC Comments on BBRKC assessment {-}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2021):** 

*“The CPT was concerned that the ‘information’ content of the data with respect to natural mortality could be related to strong assumptions elsewhere in the model, and recommended further exploration of natural mortality after September and suggested attending the June 2021 CAPAM workshop on natural mortality, which may provide some insights into best practices. A large increase in estimated natural mortality would likely increase fishing mortality reference points, with management implications.”*

Response: Model runs in May 2022 addressed some variations on M. Estimated M values in the length-based crab models tend to have higher values than the other approaches, and confounding among estimated M, survey selectivity/catchability, and recruitment in a length-based model makes it difficult to accurately estimate M in the model. Among the models presented here four address variations in M for males, including higher fixed M values and estimated M for males.

*“The CPT was interested in more exploration of the retrospective patterns, which seem to have increased since the last assessment despite no new data being added. Reported Mohn’s rhos were starting to reach concerning magnitudes in the proposed models?”*

Response: The catch and bycatch updates in May 2022 made the retrospective patterns slightly worse than before. Higher than expected BSFRF survey biomass during 2007-2008 and 2013-2016 and NMFS survey biomass in 2014 likely caused these biases. Also, much lower than expected NMFS survey biomass during 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 results in lower biomass estimates in recent years. The biases for total abundance are much smaller than mature male biomass. Explorations further, since May 2022, on retrospective patterns are underway but not presented here. 
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from September 2021):** 

*“When projecting the stock to determine whether it is approaching an overfished condition, identify the uncertainties included and ignored in the projection. It is particularly important to distinguish those that are captured in the projection (i.e. those associated with the model) and the additional uncertainties that form the basis for the ABC buffer.”*

Response: Uncertainties are discussed in the projection section here and will be included in the final SAFE in Sept. 2023.

*“When projecting MMB, label figures with the date to which it is projected (e.g., Feb. 15, 2022), not just the year (which can lead to confusion).”*

Response: We followed this recommendation.

*“Consider a model in which the data starts in 1985 (as suggested by the CIE reviewers).”*

Response: Model 22.0 start in 1985, and was presented in May 2022, Sept 2023, and in this document. After discussions during the Jan/Feb council cycle the author is uncertain whether removing the early part of the time series is appropriate. However, this model is presented here as an option.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2022):** 

*"The CPT recommended examining how the initial conditions of abundance are treated as a future analysis"*

Response: This has not yet been addressed, but is on the list for future work.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from June 2021):**

*“The SSC supports exploring more modern methods for estimating natural mortality, but notes that this method still relies strongly on the maximum age for BBRKC. The SSC recommends continued research to validate the ages for this stock.”*

Response: We agree with this suggestion. The maximum age was determined by old tagging data, and due to funding and personnel constraint, age validation for BBRKC is more likely a long-term goal than a short-term project.

*“The likelihood profile suggests that the values of M for male and female might be similar and that the current difference may be because of the constraint of base M to a low value. When M is misspecified, it can be the cause of a strong positive retrospective pattern, which BBRKC has. The SSC would have liked to have seen compositional fits and a retrospective analysis for model 19.6 or some model with a higher M value, particularly to see if it fits the plus group better. Despite the increase in F35%, there was not a commensurate increase in OFL. An exploration of the underlying reasons for this outcome is needed.”*

Response: Based on our past modelling experience, when M values for males and females are estimated separately, estimated M values tended to be always higher for females than for males. The likelihood profile was created through fixing M values for males and estimating M values for females, and when the fixed M values for males were very high, estimated M values for females tended to be similar to M values for males. The increase in F35% but not a commensurate increase in OFL is due to reduction of mature male biomass caused by the high M. 

As a reference, we copied the likelihood profile computed in May 2020 below. Model 19.6 uses male base M of 0.257 estimated by Then et al. (2015), and the likelihood profile of base M from 0.1 to 0.4 is as follow:

```{r Mprofile, fig.cap = "Likelihood profile on M from May 2020 and 2021, current values of M are circled on the profile."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/likelihood profile M_2020.png", dpi = 125)
```

It appears that the maximum likelihood value is achieved with a base M of 0.31 for males and 0.321 for females.

In May 2023, models 23.0, 23.0a, 23.0b, and 23.3 all involve variations of higher base M values for males. Higher base M values do not appear to improve the plus group fittings.  

*“In addition to the CPT recommended models (19.3d, 19.3e, and 19.3g), the SSC recommends a simplified version of model 19.3d that estimates one natural mortality parameter across sex and time, and one shared catchability and selectivity curve for the NMFS trawl survey to help make several selectivity parameters better defined.”*

Response: We named this as model 21.0 and included it in the September 2021 assessment.

*“The SSC requests that the current crab management zones be included in the maps of VAST model-derived spatial distributions of BBRKC.”*

Response: We will ask Dr. Jon Richar to add the current crab management zones to the VAST spatial plots.

*“The SSC also looks forward to the summary report from the March 2021 CIE Review for this stock.”*

Response: The summary report of the 2021 CIE review is included in Appendix D of the last full SAFE (see link in summary above).
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2021):**

*“The SSC requests that in addition to temperature effects on the timing of the molt-mate cycle, the authors explore other potential drivers (e.g., prey quality or quantity) that could underlie the incomplete molt-mate cycle observed in 2021. Based on NMFS trawl survey female biomass estimates, the State of Alaska closed the BBRKC fishery. Next year’s assessment should estimate the probability that the stock is currently in the overfished condition.”*

Response: NMFS staff did an evaluation of re-tow survey protocol in Spring 2022, no changes were adopted at that time. Probabilities in the overfished condition for some models were estimated in September 2021, May 2022, and for the base model in September 2022. Model 23.2 is presented here, in May 2023, was an exploration of the base model (21.1b) without the retow data for females. This model does not drastically affect the federal harvest control rules, but does estimate a lower biomass for females which would directly affect the State harvest strategy.   

*“The SSC recommends that authors should carefully consider assessment implications of the stock boundaries given the evidence of crabs outside of the managed area. The SSC suggests that the authors should still be able to use data from outside stock boundaries, even if not used in the input survey abundance estimates. For example, the abundance seen outside stock boundaries could be treated as covariate informing catchability within the model. This analysis seems particularly important for females that are increasingly outside of the current stock boundaries and are at low abundance, triggering the State closure. The SSC recommends that the authors formulate separate survey abundance time series inside and outside of the defined area that could prove useful in the assessment model (e.g., informing catchability). If this is not an option in the stock assessment, then it highlights the need for ESRs or ESPs to track movement of these crabs both through survey results and developing indices from local knowledge.”* 

Response: The current version of GMACS seems not to be able to use the Northern RKC survey index to inform BBRKC survey catchability. We tried to add a model to include both BBRKC and Northern RKC data, but the groundfish fisheries bycatch is not currently available in the Northern area. IN the last full SAFE - September 2022 - we plotted more proportional data of the Northern RKC in Figures 35a and 35b. Overall, the proportions of different size groups of the Northern RKC during a recent dozen years are higher than in the past and do not trend higher except for mature females in 2021. The high survey mature female abundance in the Northern area in 2021 was primarily from three tows and one of them is more than 50% of total mature females. The survey abundance of the Northern RKC will continue to be plotted in the SAFE report in the future. After migration patterns between BBRKC and the Northern RKC are fully understood, we will model them in the stock assessment.    

*“The SSC supports the BSFRF collaborative work with ADF&G and NMFS to tag BBRKC.”*

Response: We fully support tagging efforts, especially those to understand seasonal movement and the flow of individuals in or out of the Bristol Bay management area.

*“It would be useful to investigate if there is a mechanism for higher natural mortality or fishing mortality for females only during that early time period while following the CPT recommendation of looking at model 21.0 with constant but separate Ms by sex. Since Model 21.0 estimates a very high level of fishing mortality, but does seem to account for the decline in large females, there may be a fishery selectivity issue in that period. If the modelers choose not to continue to use historic data prior to 1985, this suggestion may not be useful.”*

Response: Figuring out the exact causes of high mortality in the early 1980s is always difficult and we summarize the potential causes in Appendix A of the last full SAFE, section C-vi, “Potential Reasons for High Mortality during the Early 1980s”. The directed fishery does not catch many large females and small crab, so it is difficult to remove these crab from the fishery. If this period of high natural mortality was a concern, it would be preferred to start the model in 1985, which has two advantages: avoiding the early 1980s period so that a constant M over time can be used, and the same NMFS survey gear throughout the whole model time period.     

*“The SSC supports continued exploration of the use of VAST estimates for this assessment, particularly if their use will inform mechanisms underlying shifting distributions outside of the current management area.”*

Response: We also support improvement of VAST estimates and are willing to provide feedback to Jon for further improvement. In general the CPT has not prioritized using VAST output in crab models, we hope to revisit this soon.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from June 2022):**

*The SSC noted that during preliminary model runs in May, a full document need not be produced, but one that focuses a summary of model features and runs would be sufficient.*

Response: The May 2023 proposed model run document reflects these changes, focusing on model runs and explorations. Model structure and historical information is linked to via the NPFMC website in the summary section and not repeated in this document. The author welcomes further suggestions on the "proposed model" run documents since the CPT does not formally have a format for these.

*"The SSC recommends exploring how to estimate both catchabilities (NMFS trawl survey and BSFRF survey), but with a linked prior to influence them to scale together (i.e., assume some approximate value of how much higher q is for that survey)."*

Response: This is on the authors list of future work to be addressed with explorations of catchability for both surveys, but has not yet been explored in this document.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2022):**

*"The SSC recommends that a high priority be placed on trying to isolate factors that reduce the retrospective bias in mature male biomass."*

Response: The author agrees that this should be a high priority, however current explorations are still ongoing.  

*"The SSC recommends investigation of the highly biased fits to the BSFRF index and suggests that the current approach of inflating the variance to account for lack of fit is inappropriate when obvious bias is present."*

Response: We agree with this recommendation, and are investigating this avenue along with exploring catchability for both surveys.

*"The accumulation of large males and particularly large females in the plus group indicates length bin groups may need to be re-evaluated."*

Response: We acknowledge this observation and have extending the size bins on the list of further work for this model. 

*"The SSC noted that the NMFS and the State determined that the survey re-tows would not be conducted in 2022, despite meeting the threshold to do so. The SSC requests an examination from the assessment author of the potential value of these re-tows, and whether re-tows provide a more or less accurate index of abundance."*

Response: We present model 23.2 in this document as a bookend for the model output without any retow data. If the CPT and SSC wish to see more variations of this model we can provide them, i.e. removing some years and not all as one possibility. While female re-tow data does not highly affect male model outcomes it does affect fishery closures since the State of Alaska harvest strategy uses a mature female threshold for opening.


# C. Introduction {-}

## Scientific Name {-}
Red king crab (RKC), *Paralithodes camtschaticus*, in Bristol Bay, Alaska.

## Distribution {-}
Red king crab inhabit intertidal waters to depths >200 m of the North Pacific Ocean from British Columbia, Canada, to the Bering Sea, and south to Hokkaido, Japan, and are found in several areas of the Aleutian Islands, eastern Bering Sea, and the Gulf of Alaska.

## Stock Structure {-}
The State of Alaska divides the Aleutian Islands and eastern Bering Sea into three management registration areas to manage RKC fisheries: Aleutian Islands, Bristol Bay, and Bering Sea (ADF&G 2012). The Bristol Bay area includes all waters north of the latitude of Cape Sarichef (54°36' N lat.), east of 168°00' W long., and south of the latitude of Cape Newenham (58°39' N lat.) and the fishery for RKC in this area is managed separately from fisheries for RKC outside of this area; i.e., the red king crab in the Bristol Bay area are assumed to be a separate stock from red king crab outside of this area. This report summarizes the stock assessment results for the Bristol Bay RKC stock.

## Life History {-}
Red king crab have a complex life history. Fecundity is a function of female size, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands (Haynes 1968; Swiney et al. 2012). The eggs are extruded by females, fertilized in the spring, and held by females for about 11 months (Powell and Nickerson 1965). Fertilized eggs are hatched in the spring, most during April-June (Weber 1967). Primiparous females are bred a few weeks earlier in the season than multiparous females.
Larval duration and juvenile crab growth depend on temperature (Stevens 1990; Stevens and Swiney 2007). Male and female RKC mature at 5–12 years old, depending on stock and temperature (Stevens 1990; Loher et al. 2001) and may live >20 years (Matsuura and Takeshita 1990). Males and females attain a maximum size of 227 mm and 195 mm carapace length (CL), respectively (Powell and Nickerson 1965). Female maturity is evaluated by the size at which females are observed to carry egg clutches. Male maturity can be defined by multiple criteria including spermataphore production and size, chelae vs. carapace allometry, and participation in mating in situ (reviewed by Webb 2014). For management purposes, females >89 mm CL and males >119 mm CL are assumed to be mature for Bristol Bay RKC. Juvenile RKC molt multiple times per year until age 3 or 4; thereafter, molting continues annually in females for life and in males until maturity. Male molting frequency declines after attaining functional maturity.

## Fishery {-}
The RKC stock in Bristol Bay, Alaska, supports one of the most valuable fisheries in the United States. A review of the history of the Bristol Bay RKC fishery is provided in Fitch et al. (2012) and Otto (1989). The Japanese fleet started the fishery in the early 1930s, stopped fishing from 1940 to 1952, and resumed the fishery from 1953 until 1974. The Russian fleet fished for RKC from 1959 to 1971. The Japanese fleet employed primarily tanglenets with a very small proportion of catch from trawls and pots. The Russian fleet used only tanglenets. United States trawlers started fishing Bristol Bay RKC in 1947, but the effort and catch declined in the 1950s. The domestic RKC pot fishery began to expand in the late 1960s and peaked in 1980 with a catch of 129.95 million lb (58,943 t), worth an estimated $115.3 million ex-vessel value. The catch declined dramatically in the early 1980s and has remained at low levels during the last two decades (Tables 1a and 1b). After the early 1980s stock collapse, the Bristol Bay RKC fishery took place during a short period in the fall (usually lasting about a week) with the catch quota based on the stock assessment conducted the previous summer (Zheng and Kruse 2002). Beginning with the 2005/2006 season, new regulations associated with fishery rationalization resulted in an increase in the duration of the fishing season (October 15 to January 15). With the implementation of crab rationalization, the annual guideline harvest level (GHL) was changed to a total allowable catch (TAC). Before rationalization, the implementation errors were quite high for some years and sum of actual catches from 1980 to 2007 was about 6% less than the sum of GHL/TAC over that period.

## Management History {-}
King and Tanner crab stocks in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands are managed by the State of Alaska through a federal king and Tanner crab fishery management plan (FMP). Under the FMP, management measures are divided into three categories: (1) fixed in the FMP, (2) frameworked in the FMP, and (3) discretion of the State of Alaska. The State of Alaska is responsible for determining and establishing the GHL/TAC under the framework in the FMP.
Harvest strategies for the Bristol Bay RKC fishery have changed over time. Two major management objectives for the fishery are to maintain a healthy stock that ensures reproductive viability and to provide for sustained levels of harvest over the long term (ADF&G 2012). In attempting to meet these objectives, the GHL/TAC is coupled with size-sex-season restrictions. Only males ≥6.5-in carapace width (equivalent to 135-mm CL) may be harvested and no fishing is allowed during molting and mating periods (ADF&G 2012). Specification of TAC is based on a harvest rate strategy. Before 1990, harvest rates on legal males were based on population size, abundance of prerecruits to the fishery, postrecruit abundance, and rates varied from less than 20% to 60% (Schmidt and Pengilly 1990). In 1990, the harvest strategy was modified, and a 20% mature male harvest rate was applied to the abundance of mature-sized (≥120-mm CL) males with a maximum 60% harvest rate cap of legal (≥135-mm CL) males (Pengilly and Schmidt 1995). In addition, a minimum threshold of 8.4 million mature-sized females (≥90-mm CL) was added to existing management measures to avoid recruitment overfishing (Pengilly and Schmidt 1995). Based on a new assessment model and research findings (Zheng et al. 1995a, 1995b, 1997a, 1997b), the Alaska Board of Fisheries adopted a new harvest strategy in 1996. That strategy had two mature male harvest rates: 10% when effective spawning biomass (ESB) is between 14.5 and 55.0 million lb and 15% when ESB is at or above 55.0 million lb (Zheng et al. 1996). The maximum harvest rate cap of legal males was changed from 60% to 50%. A threshold of 14.5 million lb of ESB was also added. In 1997, a minimum threshold of 4.0 million lb was established as the minimum GHL for opening the fishery and maintaining fishery viability and manageability when the stock abundance is low. The Board modified the current harvest strategy in 2003 by adding a mature harvest rate of 12.5% when the ESB is between 34.75 and 55.0 million lb and in 2012 eliminated the minimum GHL threshold. The current harvest strategy is illustrated in Figure 1.

Data on landings of Bristol Bay RKC by length and year and catch per unit effort from 1960 to 1973 were obtained from annual reports of the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (Hoopes et al. 1972; Jackson 1974; Phinney 1975) and from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game from 1974 to 2020 (Tables 1a and 1b). Bycatch data are available starting from 1990 and were obtained from the ADF&G observer database and reports (Gaeuman 2013) (Table 2). Sample sizes for catch by length and shell condition are summarized in Table 3a. Relatively large samples were taken from the retained catch each year. Sample sizes for trawl bycatch were the annual sums of length frequency samples in the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) database. 

### Catch Biomass {-}
Retained catch and estimated bycatch biomasses are summarized in Tables 1a and 1bXX and illustrated in Figure 3. Retained catch and estimated bycatch from the directed fishery include the general, open-access fishery (prior to rationalization), or the individual fishery quota (IFQ) fishery (after rationalization), as well as the Community Development Quota (CDQ) fishery and the ADF&G cost-recovery harvest. Starting in 1973, the fishery generally occurred during the late summer and fall. Before 1973, a small portion of retained catch in some years was caught from April to June. The years in Tables 1a and 1b are defined as crab year from July 1 to June 30. Bycatch data for the cost-recovery fishery before 2006 were not available. In this report, pot fisheries include both the directed fishery and RKC bycatch in the Tanner crab pot fishery, and trawl fisheries and fixed gear fisheries are groundfish fisheries. Observers did not separate retained and discarded catch of legal-sized crab after 2017 in the directed pot fishery, so the male discarded biomass from the directed fishery has been estimated by the subtraction method since 2018 (B. Daly, ADF&G, personal communication). 

### Catch Size Composition {-}
Retained catches by length and shell condition and bycatches by length, shell condition, and sex were obtained for stock assessments. From 1960 to 1966, only retained catch length compositions from the Japanese fishery were available. Retained catches from the Russian and U.S. fisheries were assumed to have the same length compositions as the Japanese fishery during this period. From 1967 to 1969, the length compositions from the Russian fishery were assumed to be the same as those from the Japanese and U.S. fisheries. After 1969, foreign catch declined sharply and only length compositions from the U.S. fishery were used to distribute catch by length.

### Catch per Unit Effort {-}
Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is defined as the number of retained crab per tan (a unit fishing effort for tanglenets) for the Japanese and Russian tanglenet fisheries and the number of retained crab per potlift for the U.S. fishery (Table 1bXX). Soak time, while an important factor influencing CPUE, is difficult to standardize. Furthermore, complete historical soak time data from the U.S. fishery are not available. Based on the approach of Balsiger (1974), all fishing effort from Japan, Russia, and U.S. were standardized to the Japanese tanglenet from 1960 to 1971, and the CPUE was standardized as crab per tan. Except for the peak-to-crash years of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the correspondence between U.S. fishery CPUE and area-swept survey abundance is poor (Figure 4XX). Due to the difficulty in estimating commercial fishing catchability and crab availability to the NMFS annual trawl survey data, commercial CPUE data were not used in the model.

## NMFS Survey Data {-}
The NMFS has conducted annual trawl surveys of the eastern Bering Sea since 1968. Two vessels, each towing an eastern otter trawl with an 83 ft headrope and a 112 ft footrope, conducted this multispecies, crab-groundfish survey during the summer. Stations were sampled in the center of a systematic 20 X 20 nm grid overlaid in an area of approximately 140,000 $nm^2$. Since 1972, the trawl survey has covered the full stock distribution except in nearshore waters. The survey in Bristol Bay occurs primarily during late May and June. Tow-by-tow trawl survey data for Bristol Bay RKC during 1975-2023 were provided by NMFS. Due to survey data quality issue, only survey data after 1974 are used in the assessment models.
