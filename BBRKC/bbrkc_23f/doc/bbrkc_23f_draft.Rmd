# Executive Summary {-}
1.	**Stock**: Red king crab (RKC), *Paralithodes camtschaticus*, in Bristol Bay, Alaska.

2.	**Catches**: The domestic RKC fishery began to expand in the late 1960s and peaked in 1980 with a catch of 129.95 million lb (58,943 t). The catch declined dramatically in the early 1980s and remained at low levels during the last three decades. After rationalization, catches were relatively high before the 2010/11 season but have been on a declining trend since 2014. The retained catch in 2020/21 was approximately 2.65 million lb (1,257 t), compared to 4.5 million lb (2,027 t) in 2018/19, following a reduction in total allowable catch (TAC). The magnitude of bycatch from groundfish trawl and fixed gear fisheries has been stable and small relative to stock abundance during the last 10 years. The decline of the directed pot fishery crab/pot lift (CPUE) has been much less than the retained catch decline, with the 2020/21 CPUE having about 12.5% reduction from the average CPUE during the recent 20 years. The directed pot fishery has been closed the past two season due to low mature female abundance in accordance with the State of Alaska harvest strategy. 

3.	**Stock biomass**: Estimated mature biomass increased dramatically in the mid-1970s, then decreased precipitously in the early 1980s. Estimated mature crab abundances increased during 1985-2007 with mature females being about four times more abundant in 2007 than in 1985 and mature males being about two times more abundant in 2007 than in 1985. Estimated mature abundance has steadily declined since 2007. The projected mature male biomass in 2023 is approximately 34% of the estimate mean survey biomass for the entire time series. The estimated mature female biomass has also been very low during the last four years, but the 2023 estimated value increased to approximately 52% of the mean, however this estimate includes increased variability about this mean.

4.	**Recruitment**: Estimated recruitment was high during the 1970s and early 1980s and has generally been low since 1985 (1979-year class). During 1984-2022, estimated recruitment was above the historical average (1976-2022 reference years) only in 1984, 1986, 1990, 1995, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2010. Estimated recruitment was extremely low during the last 13 years, and even lower during the recent eight years. With the low recruitment in recent years, the projected mature biomass is expected to decline during the next few years with a below-average fishing mortality of 0.167 to 0.25 $yr^{-1}$.

5.	**Management performance**: The stock was above MSST in 2022/2023 (85% of BMSY) and hence was not overfished. Since total catch was below OFL, overfishing did not occur. The projection using the lowest recruitment periods during 2013-2022 would not likely result in “approaching an overfished condition” based on the current harvest strategy. The relatively low MSST in 2018/19 and B~35%~ in 2019/20 below was caused by a problem of the previous GMACS version using the only sex ratio of recruitment in the terminal year for B~35%~ computation in 2019. The lower estimated male recruitment ratio in the terminal year in 2019 resulted in a lower mean male recruitment for B~35%~ computation.  The current version of GMACS uses an average of sex ratios of recruitment during the reference period to estimate B~35%~, which results in a stable sex ratio (about 50%) for the reference point calculation.   
The ABC buffer was increased from 10% to 20% in 2018, and an additional buffer of 5% was added in 2020 due to the lack of a 2020 survey. A 20% buffer was recommended by the CPT and SSC for ABC estimation since 2021/22. Reoccurring concerns for this stock are still present (cold pool distributional shifts, declining trends in mature biomass, lack of large recruitment pulses, retrospective patterns), in addition to low mature female biomass the last two years, all contribute to a recommended 20% buffer for 2023/24.

# A. Summary of Major Changes {-}

## 1. Changes in Management of the Fishery {-}

There are no new changes in management of the fishery.

## 2. Changes to the Input Data {-}
a.	Updated groundfish fisheries bycatch data during 1986-2022.
b.	Updated NMFS survey data for 2023, biomass and length compositions
c.	Updated length composition data for directed and non-directed fisheries.

## 3. Changes in Assessment Methodology {-}
a. Updated version of GMACS (version 2.01.M.01, 2023-03-13) is used.
b. The analyses of terminal years of recruitment are updated. 
c. Three models are compared in this report (See Section E.3.a for details), these models are designed for evaluating starting the model in 1985 and estimating M for males:

|         **21.1b**: base model accepted in 2022 

|         **22.0**: model 21.1b + starting in 1985.

|         **23.0a**: model 22.0 + estimating a constant base M for males.



## 4. Changes in Assessment Results {-}

Three model scenarios are compared in this report. In the May 2023 draft report the accepted model in 2022 (21.1b) was presented using the newest version of GMACS, and this had minimal effects. Model 21.1b is considered the base model and was used to compare to the other model scenarios. 

The two additional models are considered - model 22.0 (1985 start date) and model 23.0a (estimated base M for males). Model 22.0, which starts the model in 1985 rather that the 1975 start date of the base model (21.1b), was used to evaluate model starting year. Model 22.0 is the reduced time series data version of model 21.1b, and the overall results are similar. The notable differences are smaller B~35%~ (19,967 t vs 21,719 t) and NMFS survey catchability (0.94 vs 0.97), and higher OFL (3,917 t vs 3,522 t) for model 22.0. These differences are likely caused by a high recruitment in 1984 (associated with the very high M) being used for B~35%~ computation for model 21.1b and more influence of BSFRF survey data for model 22.0. Model 23.0a uses the entire time series but estimates a base M for males (0.23 compared to fixing at 0.18 for the base model). This model has a slightly reduced total likelihood compared to model 21.1b, slightly increased annual mature male biomass - with the except of the last four years, and results in an estimated B~35%~ about 10% lower than model 21.1b. A higher M also results in higher F~35%~ and OFL for model 23.0a. 

Based on the model results, it appears that the choice of preferred models depends on two factors: model starting year and estimation of M. Moving the starting year to 1985 greatly simplifies this model by removing early years of high biomass and subsequent dramatic decline in biomass in the early 80s. Additionally, a 1985 start date coincides to gear changes in the NMFS trawl survey in the early 80s. However, retrospective patterns for this model suggest increased retropspective bias which is a cause for concern. Considerations for M estimation are whether to estimate a base M for males for the whole time series or keep the base M for males fixed at 0.18. Estimating the base M for males does reduce the retrospective bias from model 21.1b. The concern with estimating a base M for males for the whole time series is potential confounding with estimating trawl survey catchability, however trawl survey catchability in this model has a fairly strict prior.

For specification in 2023/24, model 21.1b or model 23.0a are recommended. The base model - 21.1b - has been used, with minimal updates, for the past two seasons and is consistent in its approach of keeping a fixed base M of 0.18 and not removing early data. Model 23.0a, however, is a strong contender having similar trends, more realistic natural mortality estimates, and an improved retrospective bias. Model 22.0 is not recommended due to the larger retrospective bias.  
Model 21.1b results are presented in the specification tables in the executive summary but values for management-related quantities for all models are summarized in (Tables \@ref(tab:likelihood-components) and \@ref(tab:specs)).


# B. Responses to SSC and CPT  {-}
## CPT and SSC Comments on Assessments in General {-}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments (June 2022, Oct 2022):**

*"The SSC recommends that the RKC authors work together to complete a stock structure template for June 2023."*

Response: A draft stock structure template for RKC in the Bering Sea will be presented at the May 2023 CPT meeting. 

*"The SSC suggests that the CPT develop guidelines for when to change model start dates"*

Response: This topic was taken up at the Jan 2023 CPT meeting, with some basic guidelines presented in those minutes that included keeping data unless there was a strong reason (environmental, poor data quality, model instability) to exclude the data and data exclusion did not lead to drastic model output changes. Model 22.0, where data starts in 1985 vs 1975, is presented in this document.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments (from February 2022):**

*“The SSC supports the CPT general recommendations that all stock assessments include results from the currently accepted model with new data (base model) so that changes in model performance can be assessed. Values for management-related quantities for all models that may be recommended by the CPT or SSC should also be available.”* 

Response: We have followed these recommendations.  

## CPT and SSC Comments on BBRKC assessment {-}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2021):** 

*“The CPT was concerned that the ‘information’ content of the data with respect to natural mortality could be related to strong assumptions elsewhere in the model, and recommended further exploration of natural mortality after September and suggested attending the June 2021 CAPAM workshop on natural mortality, which may provide some insights into best practices. A large increase in estimated natural mortality would likely increase fishing mortality reference points, with management implications.”*

Response: Model runs in May 2022 addressed some variations on M. Estimated M values in the length-based crab models tend to have higher values than the other approaches, and confounding among estimated M, survey selectivity/catchability, and recruitment in a length-based model makes it difficult to accurately estimate M in the model. Among the models presented here four address variations in M for males, including higher fixed M values and estimated M for males.

*“The CPT was interested in more exploration of the retrospective patterns, which seem to have increased since the last assessment despite no new data being added. Reported Mohn’s rhos were starting to reach concerning magnitudes in the proposed models?”*

Response: The catch and bycatch updates in May 2022 made the retrospective patterns slightly worse than before. Higher than expected BSFRF survey biomass during 2007-2008 and 2013-2016 and NMFS survey biomass in 2014 likely caused these biases. Also, much lower than expected NMFS survey biomass during 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 results in lower biomass estimates in recent years. The biases for total abundance are much smaller than mature male biomass. Explorations further, since May 2022, on retrospective patterns are underway but not presented here. 
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from September 2021):** 

*“When projecting the stock to determine whether it is approaching an overfished condition, identify the uncertainties included and ignored in the projection. It is particularly important to distinguish those that are captured in the projection (i.e. those associated with the model) and the additional uncertainties that form the basis for the ABC buffer.”*

Response: Uncertainties are discussed in the projection section here and will be included in the final SAFE in Sept. 2023.

*“When projecting MMB, label figures with the date to which it is projected (e.g., Feb. 15, 2022), not just the year (which can lead to confusion).”*

Response: We followed this recommendation.

*“Consider a model in which the data starts in 1985 (as suggested by the CIE reviewers).”*

Response: Model 22.0 start in 1985, and was presented in May 2022, Sept 2023, and in this document. After discussions during the Jan/Feb council cycle the author is uncertain whether removing the early part of the time series is appropriate. However, this model is presented here as an option.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2022):** 

*"The CPT recommended examining how the initial conditions of abundance are treated as a future analysis"*

Response: This has not yet been addressed, but is on the list for future work.

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2023):**   
*"The CPT notes that confidence intervals for the estimated MMB and parameter names on the tables would be useful."*

Response: MMB figures now have the associated confidence intervals.


*"Future work recommendations include: reconsidering which growth parameters are estimated vs. specified, specifying all growth parameters outside of the model, a more through consideration of how to estimate survey catchability from BSFRF data without the strong prior on catchability that has been historically used, reconsider the shape of the survey selectivity curve, and revisit the blocking of the molting probability estimated from the tagging data."*

Response: These will be addressed, as possible, in model runs for May 2024.


\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from June 2021):**

*“The SSC supports exploring more modern methods for estimating natural mortality, but notes that this method still relies strongly on the maximum age for BBRKC. The SSC recommends continued research to validate the ages for this stock.”*

Response: We agree with this suggestion. The maximum age was determined by old tagging data, and due to funding and personnel constraint, age validation for BBRKC is more likely a long-term goal than a short-term project.

*“The likelihood profile suggests that the values of M for male and female might be similar and that the current difference may be because of the constraint of base M to a low value. When M is misspecified, it can be the cause of a strong positive retrospective pattern, which BBRKC has. The SSC would have liked to have seen compositional fits and a retrospective analysis for model 19.6 or some model with a higher M value, particularly to see if it fits the plus group better. Despite the increase in F35%, there was not a commensurate increase in OFL. An exploration of the underlying reasons for this outcome is needed.”*

Response: Based on our past modelling experience, when M values for males and females are estimated separately, estimated M values tended to be always higher for females than for males. The likelihood profile was created through fixing M values for males and estimating M values for females, and when the fixed M values for males were very high, estimated M values for females tended to be similar to M values for males. The increase in F35% but not a commensurate increase in OFL is due to reduction of mature male biomass caused by the high M. 

As a reference, we copied the likelihood profile computed in May 2020 below. Model 19.6 uses male base M of 0.257 estimated by Then et al. (2015), and the likelihood profile of base M from 0.1 to 0.4 is as follow:

```{r Mprofile, fig.cap = "Likelihood profile on M from May 2020 and 2021, current values of M are circled on the profile."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/likelihood profile M_2020.png", dpi = 125)

It appears that the maximum likelihood value is achieved with a base M of 0.31 for males and 0.321 for females.

In May 2023, models 23.0, 23.0a, 23.0b, and 23.3 all involved variations of higher base M values for males. Higher base M values do not appear to improve the plus group fittings.  

*“In addition to the CPT recommended models (19.3d, 19.3e, and 19.3g), the SSC recommends a simplified version of model 19.3d that estimates one natural mortality parameter across sex and time, and one shared catchability and selectivity curve for the NMFS trawl survey to help make several selectivity parameters better defined.”*

Response: We named this as model 21.0 and included it in the September 2021 assessment.

*“The SSC requests that the current crab management zones be included in the maps of VAST model-derived spatial distributions of BBRKC.”*

Response: We will ask Dr. Jon Richar to add the current crab management zones to the VAST spatial plots.

*“The SSC also looks forward to the summary report from the March 2021 CIE Review for this stock.”*

Response: The summary report of the 2021 CIE review is included in Appendix D of the last full SAFE (see link in summary above).

**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2021):**

*“The SSC requests that in addition to temperature effects on the timing of the molt-mate cycle, the authors explore other potential drivers (e.g., prey quality or quantity) that could underlie the incomplete molt-mate cycle observed in 2021. Based on NMFS trawl survey female biomass estimates, the State of Alaska closed the BBRKC fishery. Next year’s assessment should estimate the probability that the stock is currently in the overfished condition.”*

Response: NMFS staff did an evaluation of re-tow survey protocol in Spring 2022, no changes were adopted at that time. Probabilities in the overfished condition for some models were estimated in September 2021, May 2022, and for the base model in September 2022. Model 23.2 is presented here, in May 2023, was an exploration of the base model (21.1b) without the retow data for females. This model does not drastically affect the federal harvest control rules, but does estimate a lower biomass for females which would directly affect the State harvest strategy.   

*“The SSC recommends that authors should carefully consider assessment implications of the stock boundaries given the evidence of crabs outside of the managed area. The SSC suggests that the authors should still be able to use data from outside stock boundaries, even if not used in the input survey abundance estimates. For example, the abundance seen outside stock boundaries could be treated as covariate informing catchability within the model. This analysis seems particularly important for females that are increasingly outside of the current stock boundaries and are at low abundance, triggering the State closure. The SSC recommends that the authors formulate separate survey abundance time series inside and outside of the defined area that could prove useful in the assessment model (e.g., informing catchability). If this is not an option in the stock assessment, then it highlights the need for ESRs or ESPs to track movement of these crabs both through survey results and developing indices from local knowledge.”* 

Response: The current version of GMACS seems not to be able to use the Northern RKC survey index to inform BBRKC survey catchability. We tried to add a model to include both BBRKC and Northern RKC data, but the groundfish fisheries bycatch is not currently available in the Northern area. IN the last full SAFE - September 2022 - we plotted more proportional data of the Northern RKC in Figures 35a and 35b. Overall, the proportions of different size groups of the Northern RKC during a recent dozen years are higher than in the past and do not trend higher except for mature females in 2021. The high survey mature female abundance in the Northern area in 2021 was primarily from three tows and one of them is more than 50% of total mature females. The survey abundance of the Northern RKC will continue to be plotted in the SAFE report in the future. After migration patterns between BBRKC and the Northern RKC are fully understood, we will model them in the stock assessment.    

*“The SSC supports the BSFRF collaborative work with ADF&G and NMFS to tag BBRKC.”*

Response: We fully support tagging efforts, especially those to understand seasonal movement and the flow of individuals in or out of the Bristol Bay management area.

*“It would be useful to investigate if there is a mechanism for higher natural mortality or fishing mortality for females only during that early time period while following the CPT recommendation of looking at model 21.0 with constant but separate Ms by sex. Since Model 21.0 estimates a very high level of fishing mortality, but does seem to account for the decline in large females, there may be a fishery selectivity issue in that period. If the modelers choose not to continue to use historic data prior to 1985, this suggestion may not be useful.”*

Response: Figuring out the exact causes of high mortality in the early 1980s is always difficult and we summarize the potential causes in Appendix A of the last full SAFE, section C-vi, “Potential Reasons for High Mortality during the Early 1980s”. The directed fishery does not catch many large females and small crab, so it is difficult to remove these crab from the fishery. If this period of high natural mortality was a concern, it would be preferred to start the model in 1985, which has two advantages: avoiding the early 1980s period so that a constant M over time can be used, and the same NMFS survey gear throughout the whole model time period.     

*“The SSC supports continued exploration of the use of VAST estimates for this assessment, particularly if their use will inform mechanisms underlying shifting distributions outside of the current management area.”*

Response: We also support improvement of VAST estimates and are willing to provide feedback to Jon for further improvement. In general the CPT has not prioritized using VAST output in crab models, we hope to revisit this soon.

**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from June 2022):**

*The SSC noted that during preliminary model runs in May, a full document need not be produced, but one that focuses a summary of model features and runs would be sufficient.*

Response: The May 2023 proposed model run document reflects these changes, focusing on model runs and explorations. Model structure and historical information is linked to via the NPFMC website in the summary section and not repeated in this document. The author welcomes further suggestions on the "proposed model" run documents since the CPT does not formally have a format for these.

*"The SSC recommends exploring how to estimate both catchabilities (NMFS trawl survey and BSFRF survey), but with a linked prior to influence them to scale together (i.e., assume some approximate value of how much higher q is for that survey)."*

Response: This is on the authors list of future work to be addressed with explorations of catchability for both surveys, but has not yet been explored in this document.
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2022):**

*"The SSC recommends that a high priority be placed on trying to isolate factors that reduce the retrospective bias in mature male biomass."*

Response: The author agrees that this should be a high priority, however current explorations are still ongoing.  

*"The SSC recommends investigation of the highly biased fits to the BSFRF index and suggests that the current approach of inflating the variance to account for lack of fit is inappropriate when obvious bias is present."*

Response: We agree with this recommendation, and are investigating this avenue along with exploring catchability for both surveys.

*"The accumulation of large males and particularly large females in the plus group indicates length bin groups may need to be re-evaluated."*

Response: We acknowledge this observation and have extending the size bins on the list of further work for this model. 

*"The SSC noted that the NMFS and the State determined that the survey re-tows would not be conducted in 2022, despite meeting the threshold to do so. The SSC requests an examination from the assessment author of the potential value of these re-tows, and whether re-tows provide a more or less accurate index of abundance."*

Response: Model 23.2 was presented in May 2023 as a bookend for the model output without any retow data. If the CPT and SSC wish to see more variations of this model we can provide them, i.e. removing some years and not all as one possibility. While female re-tow data does not highly affect male model outcomes it does affect fishery closures since the State of Alaska harvest strategy uses a mature female threshold for opening.


# C. Introduction {-}

## 1. Scientific Name {-}
Red king crab (RKC), *Paralithodes camtschaticus*, in Bristol Bay, Alaska.

## 2. Distribution {-}
Red king crab inhabit intertidal waters to depths >200 m of the North Pacific Ocean from British Columbia, Canada, to the Bering Sea, and south to Hokkaido, Japan, and are found in several areas of the Aleutian Islands, eastern Bering Sea, and the Gulf of Alaska.

## 3. Stock Structure {-}
The State of Alaska divides the Aleutian Islands and eastern Bering Sea into three management registration areas to manage RKC fisheries: Aleutian Islands, Bristol Bay, and Bering Sea (ADF&G 2012). The Bristol Bay area includes all waters north of the latitude of Cape Sarichef (54°36' N lat.), east of 168°00' W long., and south of the latitude of Cape Newenham (58°39' N lat.) and the fishery for RKC in this area is managed separately from fisheries for RKC outside of this area; i.e., the red king crab in the Bristol Bay area are assumed to be a separate stock from red king crab outside of this area. This report summarizes the stock assessment results for the Bristol Bay RKC stock.

## 4. Life History {-}
Red king crab have a complex life history. Fecundity is a function of female size, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands (Haynes 1968; Swiney et al. 2012). The eggs are extruded by females, fertilized in the spring, and held by females for about 11 months (Powell and Nickerson 1965). Fertilized eggs are hatched in the spring, most during April-June (Weber 1967). Primiparous females are bred a few weeks earlier in the season than multiparous females.
Larval duration and juvenile crab growth depend on temperature (Stevens 1990; Stevens and Swiney 2007). Male and female RKC mature at 5–12 years old, depending on stock and temperature (Stevens 1990; Loher et al. 2001) and may live >20 years (Matsuura and Takeshita 1990). Males and females attain a maximum size of 227 mm and 195 mm carapace length (CL), respectively (Powell and Nickerson 1965). Female maturity is evaluated by the size at which females are observed to carry egg clutches. Male maturity can be defined by multiple criteria including spermataphore production and size, chelae vs. carapace allometry, and participation in mating in situ (reviewed by Webb 2014). For management purposes, females >89 mm CL and males >119 mm CL are assumed to be mature for Bristol Bay RKC. Juvenile RKC molt multiple times per year until age 3 or 4; thereafter, molting continues annually in females for life and in males until maturity. Male molting frequency declines after attaining functional maturity.

## 5. Fishery {-}
The RKC stock in Bristol Bay, Alaska, supports one of the most valuable fisheries in the United States. A review of the history of the Bristol Bay RKC fishery is provided in Fitch et al. (2012) and Otto (1989). The Japanese fleet started the fishery in the early 1930s, stopped fishing from 1940 to 1952, and resumed the fishery from 1953 until 1974. The Russian fleet fished for RKC from 1959 to 1971. The Japanese fleet employed primarily tanglenets with a very small proportion of catch from trawls and pots. The Russian fleet used only tanglenets. United States trawlers started fishing Bristol Bay RKC in 1947, but the effort and catch declined in the 1950s. The domestic RKC pot fishery began to expand in the late 1960s and peaked in 1980 with a catch of 129.95 million lb (58,943 t), worth an estimated $115.3 million ex-vessel value. The catch declined dramatically in the early 1980s and has remained at low levels during the last two decades (Tables \@ref(tab:totalcatch) and \@ref(tab:retainedcatch)). After the early 1980s stock collapse, the Bristol Bay RKC fishery took place during a short period in the fall (usually lasting about a week) with the catch quota based on the stock assessment conducted the previous summer (Zheng and Kruse 2002). Beginning with the 2005/2006 season, new regulations associated with fishery rationalization resulted in an increase in the duration of the fishing season (October 15 to January 15). With the implementation of crab rationalization, the annual guideline harvest level (GHL) was changed to a total allowable catch (TAC). Before rationalization, the implementation errors were quite high for some years and sum of actual catches from 1980 to 2007 was about 6% less than the sum of GHL/TAC over that period.

## 6. Management History {-}
King and Tanner crab stocks in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands are managed by the State of Alaska through a federal king and Tanner crab fishery management plan (FMP). Under the FMP, management measures are divided into three categories: (1) fixed in the FMP, (2) frameworked in the FMP, and (3) discretion of the State of Alaska. The State of Alaska is responsible for determining and establishing the GHL/TAC under the framework in the FMP.
Harvest strategies for the Bristol Bay RKC fishery have changed over time. Two major management objectives for the fishery are to maintain a healthy stock that ensures reproductive viability and to provide for sustained levels of harvest over the long term (ADF&G 2012). In attempting to meet these objectives, the GHL/TAC is coupled with size-sex-season restrictions. Only males $\geq$ 6.5in carapace width (equivalent to 135mm CL) may be harvested and no fishing is allowed during molting and mating periods (ADF&G 2012). Specification of TAC is based on a harvest rate strategy. Before 1990, harvest rates on legal males were based on population size, abundance of prerecruits to the fishery, postrecruit abundance, and rates varied from less than 20% to 60% (Schmidt and Pengilly 1990). In 1990, the harvest strategy was modified, and a 20% mature male harvest rate was applied to the abundance of mature-sized ($\geq$ 120mm CL) males with a maximum 60% harvest rate cap of legal ($\geq$ 135mm CL) males (Pengilly and Schmidt 1995). In addition, a minimum threshold of 8.4 million mature-sized females ($\geq$ 90mm CL) was added to existing management measures to avoid recruitment overfishing (Pengilly and Schmidt 1995). Based on a new assessment model and research findings (Zheng et al. 1995a, 1995b, 1997a, 1997b), the Alaska Board of Fisheries adopted a new harvest strategy in 1996. That strategy had two mature male harvest rates: 10% when effective spawning biomass (ESB) is between 14.5 and 55.0 million lb and 15% when ESB is at or above 55.0 million lb (Zheng et al. 1996). The maximum harvest rate cap of legal males was changed from 60% to 50%. A threshold of 14.5 million lb of ESB was also added. In 1997, a minimum threshold of 4.0 million lb was established as the minimum GHL for opening the fishery and maintaining fishery viability and manageability when the stock abundance is low. The Board modified the current harvest strategy in 2003 by adding a mature harvest rate of 12.5% when the ESB is between 34.75 and 55.0 million lb and in 2012 eliminated the minimum GHL threshold. The current harvest strategy is illustrated in (Figure \@ref(fig:harveststra)).


# D. Data {-}

## 1. Summary of New Information {-}
a.	Updated groundfish fisheries bycatch data during 1986-2022.
b.	Updated survey data for 2023
c.	Updated length-frequencies distributions for all data sets for 2022/2023

Data types and availability periods are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:data-extent).  


## 2. Catch Data {-}
Data on landings of Bristol Bay RKC by length and year and catch per unit effort from 1960 to 1973 were obtained from annual reports of the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (Hoopes et al. 1972; Jackson 1974; Phinney 1975) and from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game from 1974 to 2020 (Tables \@ref(tab:totalcatch) and \@ref(tab:retainedcatch)). Bycatch data are available starting from 1990 and were obtained from the ADF&G observer database and reports (Gaeuman 2013) (Table \@ref(tab:obscatch)). Sample sizes for catch by length and shell condition are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:samplesize). Relatively large samples were taken from the retained catch each year. Sample sizes for trawl bycatch were the annual sums of length frequency samples in the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) database. 

### a. Catch Biomass {-}
Retained catch and estimated bycatch biomasses are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:totalcatch) and \@ref(tab:retainedcatch) and illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:catch). Retained catch and estimated bycatch from the directed fishery include the general, open-access fishery (prior to rationalization), or the individual fishery quota (IFQ) fishery (after rationalization), as well as the Community Development Quota (CDQ) fishery and the ADF&G cost-recovery harvest. Starting in 1973, the fishery generally occurred during the late summer and fall. Before 1973, a small portion of retained catch in some years was caught from April to June. The years in Tables \@ref(tab:totalcatch) and \@ref(tab:retainedcatch) are defined as crab year from July 1 to June 30. Bycatch data for the cost-recovery fishery before 2006 were not available. In this report, pot fisheries include both the directed fishery and RKC bycatch in the Tanner crab pot fishery, and trawl fisheries and fixed gear fisheries are groundfish fisheries. Observers did not separate retained and discarded catch of legal-sized crab after 2017 in the directed pot fishery, so the male discarded biomass from the directed fishery has been estimated by the subtraction method since 2018 (B. Daly, ADF&G, personal communication). 

### b. Catch Size Composition {-}
Retained catches by length and shell condition and bycatches by length, shell condition, and sex were obtained for stock assessments. From 1960 to 1966, only retained catch length compositions from the Japanese fishery were available. Retained catches from the Russian and U.S. fisheries were assumed to have the same length compositions as the Japanese fishery during this period. From 1967 to 1969, the length compositions from the Russian fishery were assumed to be the same as those from the Japanese and U.S. fisheries. After 1969, foreign catch declined sharply and only length compositions from the U.S. fishery were used to distribute catch by length.

### c. Catch per Unit Effort {-}
Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is defined as the number of retained crab per tan (a unit fishing effort for tanglenets) for the Japanese and Russian tanglenet fisheries and the number of retained crab per potlift for the U.S. fishery (Table \@ref(tab:retainedcatch)). Soak time, while an important factor influencing CPUE, is difficult to standardize. Furthermore, complete historical soak time data from the U.S. fishery are not available. Based on the approach of Balsiger (1974), all fishing effort from Japan, Russia, and U.S. were standardized to the Japanese tanglenet from 1960 to 1971, and the CPUE was standardized as crab per tan. Except for the peak-to-crash years of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the correspondence between U.S. fishery CPUE and area-swept survey abundance is poor (Figure 4XX). Due to the difficulty in estimating commercial fishing catchability and crab availability to the NMFS annual trawl survey data, commercial CPUE data were not used in the model.

## 3. NMFS Survey Data {-}
The NMFS has conducted annual trawl surveys of the eastern Bering Sea since 1968. Two vessels, each towing an eastern otter trawl with an 83 ft headrope and a 112 ft footrope, conducted this multispecies, crab-groundfish survey during the summer. Stations were sampled in the center of a systematic 20 X 20 nm grid overlaid in an area of approximately 140,000 $nm^2$. Since 1972, the trawl survey has covered the full stock distribution except in nearshore waters. The survey in Bristol Bay occurs primarily during late May and June. Tow-by-tow trawl survey data for Bristol Bay RKC during 1975-2023 were provided by NMFS. Due to survey data quality issue, only survey data after 1974 are used in the assessment models.

Abundance estimates by sex, carapace length, and shell condition were derived from survey data using an area-swept approach (Figure \@ref(fig:male-comps) and \@ref(fig:female-comps)). Until the late 1980s, NMFS used a post-stratification approach, but subsequently treated Bristol Bay as a single stratum; the estimates shown for Bristol Bay in Figures \@ref(fig:cpue-catch) -- \@ref(fig:female-comps) were made without post-stratification. If multiple tows were made at a single station in a given year, the average of the abundances from all tows within that station was used as the estimate of abundance for that station. The new time series since 2015 discards all “hot spot” tows.  We used the new area-swept estimates provided by NMFS in 2023. The VAST estimated biomasses were not considered in this year’s assessment but may be considered in the future.

In addition to the standard surveys conducted in early June (late May to early June in 1999 and 2000), a portion of the distribution of Bristol Bay RKC was resurveyed in 1999, 2000, 2006-2012, and 2021 to better assess mature female abundance. Resurveys performed in late July, about six weeks after the standard survey, included 31 stations (1999), 23 stations (2000), 31 stations (2006, 1 bad tow and 30 valid tows), 32 stations (2007-2009), 23 stations (2010), and 20 stations (2011, 2012, and 2021) with high female densities. The resurveys were necessary because a high proportion of mature females had not yet molted or mated when sampled during the standard survey time. Differences in area-swept estimates of abundance between the standard surveys and resurveys of these same stations are attributed to survey measurement errors or to seasonal changes in distribution between survey and resurvey periods. More large females were observed in the resurveys than during the standard surveys in 1999 and 2000, presumably because most mature females had not molted prior to the standard surveys. As in 2006, area-swept estimates of males >89 mm CL, mature males, and legal males within the 32 resurvey stations in 2007 were not significantly different (P=0.74, 0.74 and 0.95; paired t-test of sample means) between the standard survey and resurvey tows. However, similar to 2006, area-swept estimates of mature females within the 32 resurvey stations in 2007 were significantly different (P=0.03; paired t-test) between the standard survey and resurvey tows. Resurvey stations were close to shore during 2010-2012, and mature and legal male abundance estimates were lower for the re-tow than the standard survey. Following the CPT recommendation, we used the standard survey data for male abundance estimates and only the resurvey data, plus the standard survey data outside the resurveyed stations, to assess female abundances during resurvey years.

## 4. Bering Sea Fisheries Research Foundation Survey Data {-}
The BSFRF conducted trawl surveys for Bristol Bay RKC in 2007 and 2008 with a small-mesh trawl net and 5-minute tows (S. Goodman, BSFRF, pers. com.). The surveys occurred at similar times as the NMFS standard surveys and covered about 97% of the Bristol Bay survey area. Few Bristol Bay RKC were found outside the BSFRF survey area. Because of the small mesh size, the BSFRF surveys were expected to catch more RKC within the swept area. Crab abundances of different size groups were estimated by the kriging method. Mature male abundances were estimated to be 22.331 million crab (CV = 0.0634) in 2007 and 19.747 million crab (CV = 0.0765) in 2008. BSFRF also conducted a side-by-side survey concurrent with the NMFS trawl survey during 2013-2016 in Bristol Bay. In May 2017, survey biomass and size composition estimates from 2016 BSFRF side-by-side trawl survey data were updated. Ratios of NMFS survey abundances/total NMFS and BSFRF side-by-side trawl survey abundances are illustrated in Figures \@ref(fig:bsfrf-compare1) and \@ref(fig:bsfrf-compare1f), and ratios of NMFS survey abundances/BSFRF side-by-side trawl survey abundances are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:bsfrf-compare2) -- \@ref(fig:bsfrf-compare3).  

As a comparison to the estimated NMFS survey catchability (0.896) at 162.5 mm CL by the double-bag experiment, we computed an overall ratio (q=0.891) of NMFS survey abundances/BSFRF side-by-side trawl survey abundances for legal crab ($\geq$ 135mm carapace length) as follow:

$q= \frac {\sum_{y=2013,l=135mm}^{y=2016,l=\infty}{r_{y,l}}n_{y,l}}{\sum_{y=2013,l=135mm}^{y=2016,l=\infty}{n_{y,l}}}$

where $r_{y,l}$ is the ratio of NMFS survey abundance/BSFRF side-by-side trawl survey abundance in year y and length group l, and $n_{y,l}$ is the combined survey abundance of side-by-side surveys in year y and length group l. Due to small catch, all haul data were combined to compute the ratios for each length group and year. 


# E. Analytic Approach {-}

## 1. History of Modeling Approaches for this Stock {-}
To reduce annual measurement errors associated with abundance estimates derived from the area-swept method, ADF&G developed a length-based analysis (LBA) in 1994 that incorporates multiple years of data and multiple data sources in the estimation procedure (Zheng et al. 1995a). Annual abundance estimates of the Bristol Bay RKC stock from the LBA have been used to manage the directed crab fishery and to set crab bycatch limits in the groundfish fisheries since 1995 (Figure \@ref(fig:harveststra)). An alternative length-based model (research model) was developed in 2004 to include small size crab to determine federal overfishing limits. Given that the crab abundance declined sharply during the early 1980s, the LBA estimated natural mortality for different periods of years, whereas the research model estimated additional mortality beyond a base constant natural mortality during 1980-1984. In this report, we present only the research model that was fit to the data from 1975 to 2023.

## 2. Model Description {-}
The original LBA model was described in detail by Zheng et al. (1995a, 1995b) and Zheng and Kruse (2002). The model combines multiple sources of survey, catch, and bycatch data using a maximum likelihood approach to estimate abundance, recruitment, selectivity, fishing mortality, catch, and bycatch of commercial pot fisheries and groundfish trawl fisheries. Since 2019, GMACS (General Model for Alaska Crab Stocks) has been used for this stock assessment. A full model description is provided in Appendix A. 

### a-f. See Appendix A {-}

### g.	Critical assumptions of the model: {-}
i.	The base natural mortality is kept constant at 0.18 $yr_1$ for males, shell condition, and length and was estimated assuming a maximum age of 25 and applying the 1% rule (Zheng 2005).
ii.	Survey and fisheries selectivities are a function of length and were constant over shell condition. Selectivities may or may not be a function of sex except for groundfish fisheries bycatch selectivities, which are the same for both sexes. Two different NMFS survey selectivities were estimated: (1) 1975-1981 and (2) 1982-2023, based on modifications to the trawl gear used in the assessment survey.
iii.	Growth is a function of length. For females, growth-per-molt increments as a function of length are estimated for three periods (1975-1982, 1983-1993, and 1994-2023) based on sizes at maturity. Once mature, female red king crab have a much smaller growth increment per molt.
iv.	Molting probabilities are an inverse logistic function of length for males. Females molt annually.
v.	Annual fishing seasons for the directed fishery are short.
vi.	The prior mean for NMFS survey catchability (Q) is estimated to be 0.896 with a standard deviation of 0.025 for some models, based on a trawl experiment by Weinberg et al. (2004); Q is assumed to be constant over time and is estimated in the model. The BSFRF survey catchability is assumed to be 1.0. The prior mean of 0.896 for NMFS survey Q (at 162.5 mm carapace length) is also close to the abundance-weighted average ratio of 0.891 for crab $\geq$ 135 mm CL across four years of side-by-side NMFS and BSFRF survey data (Figure \@ref(fig:bsfrf-compare3).
vii.	Males mature at sizes $\geq$ 120 mm CL. For convenience, female abundance is summarized at sizes $\geq$ 90 mm CL as an index of mature females.
viii.	Measurement errors are assumed to be normally distributed for length compositions and are log-normally distributed for biomasses. 

### h.	Changes to the above since previous assessment: see Section A.3 for changes to the assessment methodology. {-}
i.	Outline of methods used to validate the code used to implement the model and whether the code is available: Assessment results by GMACS have been compared to the previous assessment models, and the code is online and available from the first author. 

## 3. Model Selection and Evaluation {-}
a. Alternative model configurations (models):

**21.1b**: the base model for September 2021 with accepted updates in May 2022 and 2023 (12,13). 
Basic features of this model include:  

(1) An estimated constant M for males during 1980-1984, a constant (base) M of 0.18 for males during the other years, and an estimated constant multiplier being used to multiply male M for female M. That is, M for females is relative to M for males each year. 

(2) Including BSFRF survey data during 2007-2008 and 2013-2016. 

(3) Estimating a constant NMFS survey catchability over time in the model and assuming BSFRF survey catchability to be 1.0.

(4) Assuming the BSFRF survey selectivities as the availability to the NMFS trawl survey because the BSFRF survey gear has very small mesh sizes and has tighter contact to the sea floor. This implies that crab occurring in nearshore areas are not available to trawl survey gears. 

(5) Two levels of molting probabilities for males: one before 1980 and one after 1979, based on survey shell condition data. Each level has two parameters.

(6) Estimating effective sample size from observed sample sizes. Stage-1 effective sample sizes are estimated as min(0.25xn, N) for trawl surveys and min(0.05xn, N) for catch and bycatch, where n is the sum of observed sample sizes for two sexes, and N is the maximum sample size (200 for trawl surveys, 150 for retained catch and total males from the directed pot fishery and 50 for females from the pot fishery and for both males and females from the Tanner crab and groundfish fisheries). There is justification for enforcing a maximum limit to effective sample sizes because the number of length measurements is large (Fournier et al. 1998).

|           with the final jittered starting parameter value back-transformed as:

|       $P_{new} = P_{min} + (\frac{P_{max}-P_{min}}{1.0+exp(-2.0*temp)})$

|       where $P_{max}$ and $P_{min}$ are upper and lower bounds of parameters and $P_{val}$ is the estimated parameter value before the jittering. Jittering results are not updated and presented in this report. 



## Assessment Methodology {-}

This assessment model again uses the modeling framework GMACS and is detailed in Appendix A.
An updated version of GMACS (version 2.01.M.01, 2023-03-13) was used.


## 4. Results {-}

### a. Effective sample sizes and weighting factors {-}
i. CVs are assumed to be 0.03 for retained catch biomass, 0.04 for total male biomass, 0.07 for pot bycatch biomasses, 0.10 for groundfish bycatch biomasses, and 0.23 for recruitment sex ratio. Models also estimate sigmaR for recruitment variation and have a penalty on M variation and many prior-densities.   

ii. Initial trawl survey catchability (Q) is estimated to be 0.896 with a standard deviation of 0.025 (CV about 0.03) based on the double-bag experiment results (Weinberg et al. 2004). These values are used to set a prior for estimating Q in all models.

iii. Harmonic means of implied sample sizes and maximum caps of effective sample sizes for models 21.1b, 22.0, and 23.0a are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:harmonic).


### b. Parameter estimates and tables {-}
i.	Negative log-likelihood values and parameter estimates are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:likelihood-components) -- \@ref(tab:parm-std22) for all three models.

vi.	Time series of catch biomass is provided in Tables \@ref(tab:totalcatch) and \@ref(tab:retainedcatch).   

|       Length-specific fishing mortality is equal to selectivity-at-length times the full selection fishing mortality. Estimated full pot fishing mortalities for females and full fishing mortalities for groundfish fisheries bycatch are low due to low bycatch and handling mortality rates less than 1.0. Estimated recruits varied greatly among years (Tables \@ref(tab:est-m211b) -- \@ref(tab:est-m22)). Estimated selectivities for female pot bycatch are close to 1.0 for all mature females, and the estimated full fishing mortalities for female pot bycatch are lower than those for male retained catch and bycatch (Tables \@ref(tab:parm-std211b) -- \@ref(tab:parm-std22) for models 21.1b, 22.0, and 23.0a). 


### c. Graphs of estimates {-}
i.	Estimated selectivities by length are provided in Figures \@ref(fig:surv-sel), \@ref(fig:surv-sel2), and \@ref(fig:sel1) and estimated molting probabilities by length are illustrated in Figures \@ref(fig:molt) and \@ref(fig:molt2).  

One of the most important results is estimated trawl survey selectivity (Figures \@ref(fig:surv-sel)). Survey selectivity affects not only the fitting of the data but also the absolute abundance estimates. These estimated survey selectivities are generally smaller than the capture probabilities in Figure A1 because survey selectivities include capture probabilities and crab availability. The NMFS survey catchability is estimated to be 0.896 from the trawl experiment. The reliability of estimated survey selectivities will greatly affect the application of the model to fisheries management. Under- or over-estimates of survey selectivities will cause a systematic upward or downward bias of abundance estimates, respectively. Information about crab availability in the survey area at survey times will help estimate the survey selectivities. Higher estimated natural mortalities generally result in lower NMFS survey selectivities, while the estimated survey selectivities after 1981 are similar among the models. 

For all models, estimated molting probabilities during 1975-2023 (Figures \@ref(fig:molt) and \@ref(fig:molt2)) are generally lower than those estimated from the 1954-1961 and 1966-1969 tagging data (Balsiger 1974). Lower molting probabilities mean more oldshell crab, possibly due to changes in molting probabilities over time or shell aging errors. Overestimates or underestimates of oldshell crab will result in lower or higher estimates of male molting probabilities.  

ii.	Estimated male and female survey biomasses are shown for NMFS surveys (Figures \@ref(fig:surv1) and \@ref(fig:surv1b)) and BSFRF surveys (\@ref(fig:surv2) and \@ref(fig:surv2b)). Absolute mature male biomasses are illustrated in Figures \@ref(fig:mmb1) and \@ref(fig:mmb3).  

The survey male biomass estimates in 2023 decreased from 2022, however they are still higher than the low values of 2018, 2019, and 2021. Survey female biomass estimates increased higher than the last four years of survey estimates, however this higher estimate was due to one large tow of mature females resulting in high variability about these estimates. Estimated population biomass increased dramatically in the mid-1970s then decreased precipitously in the early 1980s. Estimated biomass had increased during 1985-2003 for males and during 1985-2007 for females, then declined, and have steadily declined since the late 2000s (Figures \@ref(fig:surv1), \@ref(fig:surv1b),\@ref(fig:mmb1), and \@ref(fig:mmb3)). Absolute mature male biomasses for all models have a similar trend over time (Figures \@ref(fig:mmb1) and \@ref(fig:mmb3)). Among the three models, model estimated relative NMFS survey biomasses are similar for two models 21.1b and 22.0. Model 23.0a estimates a constant M for males, resulting in slightly higher NMFS survey biomass estimates in the early part of the time series and lower in recent years than the other models. All models fit the catch and bycatch biomasses very well.  

The fit to BSFRF survey data and estimated survey selectivities are illustrated in Figures \@ref(fig:surv2) and \@ref(fig:surv2b), but are all similar in their results.  

iii.	Estimated recruitment time series are plotted in Figures \@ref(fig:rect1) and \@ref(fig:rect2) for models 21.1b, 22.0, and 23.0a. Recruitment is estimated at the end of year in GMACS and is moved up one year for the beginning of next year. Estimated recruitment time series for models 21.1b, 22.0, and 23.0a are similar. Estimated recruitments among models with higher M values are generally higher.   

Like the results of previous models, the terminal year recruitment analysis with model 21.1b suggests the estimated recruitment in the last year should not be used for estimating B~35%~ (Figure \@ref(fig:retroRec2) and \@ref(fig:retroRec3)).   

iv.	Estimated fishing mortality rates are plotted against mature male biomass in Figures \@ref(fig:fmort), \@ref(fig:fmort2), and \@ref(fig:fmort3) for models 21.1b, 22.0, and 23.0a, and estimated M and directed pot fishing mortality values over time are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:Nmort) and \@ref(fig:fmortC) for models 21.1b, 22.0, and 23.0a.  

The average of estimated male recruits from 1984 to 2022 for models starting in 1975 and from 1986 to 2022 for models starting in 1985 (Figure \@ref(fig:rect2)) and mature male biomass per recruit are used to estimate B~35%~. The full fishing mortalities for the directed pot fishery at the time of fishing are plotted against mature male biomass on Feb. 15 (Figures \@ref(fig:fmort), \@ref(fig:fmort2), and \@ref(fig:fmort3)). Estimated fishing mortalities in most years before the current harvest strategy was adopted in 1996 were above F~35%~ (Figures \@ref(fig:fmort), \@ref(fig:fmort2), and \@ref(fig:fmort3)). Under the current harvest strategy, estimated fishing mortalities were at or above the F~35%~ limits in 1998-1999, 2005, 2007-2010, and 2014-2019 in the model presented, but below the F~35%~ limits in the other post-1995 years.   

For model 21.1b, estimated full pot fishing mortalities ranged from 0.00 to 2.27 during 1975-2020, with estimated values over 0.40 during 1975-1982, 1984-1987, 1990-1991, 1993, 1998 and 2007-2009 (Table \@ref(tab:est-m211b), Figure \@ref(fig:fmort)). For model 22.0, estimated full pot fishing mortalities ranged from 0.00 to 0.70 during 1985-2020, with estimated values over 0.40 in the same years as model 21.1b. Estimated fishing mortalities for pot female and groundfish fisheries bycatches are generally small and less than 0.07. 

For model 21.1b, estimated M values are 0.89 during 1980-1984 and 0.18 for the other years for males, and 1.17 during 1980-1984 and 0.24 for the other years for females, with estimated female M values equaling to 1.325 times male M values (Figure \@ref(fig:Nmort)). For model 22.0, estimated M values 0.18 for all years for males, and 0.23 for females, with estimated female M values equaling to 1.327 times male M values. For model 23.0a, estimates M for males is 0.23, higher than the fixed value of 0.18 in the other models, while M for females is estimated at 0.27, only slightly higher than the base model. Biologically, females mature earlier than males and likely have higher M values. M values for all models are listed in Table \@ref(tab:Natmort).    

v.	Estimated mature male biomass and recruitment are plotted to illustrate their relationships with model 21.1b (Figure \@ref(fig:stockr)). Annual stock productivities are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:stockr2). 
Stock productivity (recruitment/mature male biomass) is generally lower during the last 20 years (Figure \@ref(fig:stockr2)). However, there are high variations for the relation of stock productivity against mature male biomass.  

Egg clutch data collected during summer surveys may provide information about mature female reproductive conditions (Figures \@ref(fig:clutch) and \@ref(fig:clutchfull)). Although egg clutch data are subject to rating errors as well as sampling errors, data trends over time may be useful. Proportions of empty clutches for newshell mature females >89 mm CL are high in some years before 1990 but have been low since 1990 (Figure \@ref(fig:clutch)). The high proportion of empty clutches (0.2) was in 1986, and primarily involved soft shell females (shell condition 1). Clutch fullness fluctuated annually around average levels during two periods: before 1991 and after 1990 (Figure \@ref(fig:clutch)). The average clutch fullness is similar for these two periods (Figure \@ref(fig:clutch)). Egg clutch fullness in the last ten years appears to oscillate up and down from the later period average but still remains higher than 75%.


### d. Evaluation of the fit to the data.{-}
i.	Observed vs. estimated catches are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:est-catch), with bycatch mortalities from different sources shown in Figure \@ref(fig:est-catch) for all models.  

ii.	Model fits to NMFS survey biomass are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:surv1) and \@ref(fig:surv1b) with a standardized residual plot in Figure \@ref(fig:surv1-res) for models 21.1b, 22.0, and 23.0a.  

iii.	Model fits to catch and survey proportions by length are illustrated in Figures \@ref(fig:sc-pot) -- \@ref(fig:sc-tannerF) and residual bubble plots are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:sc-res-ref-M) -- \@ref(fig:sc-res-F4).  

All models fit the fishery biomass data well and the survey biomass reasonably well (Figures \@ref(fig:surv1), \@ref(fig:surv1b), \@ref(fig:est-catch)). Because the model estimates annual fishing mortality for directed pot male catch, pot female bycatch, and trawl and fixed gear bycatch, the deviations of observed and predicted (estimated) fishery biomass are mainly due to size composition differences. All models fit the NMFS area-swept biomass data almost identically (Figures \@ref(fig:surv1) and \@ref(fig:surv1b)).
All models also fit the length composition data well (Figures \@ref(fig:sc-pot) -- \@ref(fig:sc-tannerF)). Modal progressions are tracked well in the trawl survey data, particularly beginning in mid-1990s (Figures \@ref(fig:sc-trawl1) and \@ref(fig:sc-trawl1F)). Cohorts first seen in the trawl survey data in 1975, 1986, 1990, 1995, 1999, 2002 and 2005 can be tracked over time. Some cohorts can be tracked over time in the pot bycatch as well (Figure \@ref(fig:sc-pot)), but the bycatch data did not track the cohorts as well as the survey data. Groundfish bycatch data provide little information to track modal progression.  
Residuals of survey biomasses and proportions of length are plotted to examine their patterns. Residuals were calculated as observed minus predicted and standardized by the estimated standard deviation. Residuals of survey biomasses did not show any consistent patterns for all models (Figures \@ref(fig:sc-res-ref-M) -- \@ref(fig:sc-res-F4)).   Generally, residuals of proportions of survey males and females appear to be random over length and year for all models (Figures \@ref(fig:sc-res-ref-M) -- \@ref(fig:sc-res-F4)). Models with higher base M values like model 23.0a improve the plus group fittings slightly.   


### e. Retrospective and historical analyses {-}
Retrospective analyses were conducted for this report using the 2023 models. The 2023 model hindcast results are based on sequentially excluding one-year of data to evaluate the current model performance with fewer data.   

i.	Retrospective analysis (retrospective bias in base model or models).  
The performance of the 2023 model includes sequentially excluding one-year of data. Model 21.1b produces some upward biases during 2013-2023 with higher terminal year estimates of mature male biomass in 2014-2022 (Figure \@ref(fig:retro211b)). Higher than expected BSFRF survey biomass during 2007-2008 and 2013-2016 and NMFS survey biomass in 2014 likely caused these biases. Also, much lower than expected NMFS survey biomass during 2018-2019 results in lower biomass estimates in 2020 and 2021. Model 22.0, with starting year of 1985 has a similar result (Figure \@ref(fig:retro22)), but with higher bias values. Mohn’s rho calculations for these retrospective runs were high (0.242 to 0.418) but were reduced some in model 23.0a, which estimates a base M for males in the model.  
Ratios of estimated retrospective recruitments to terminal estimates in 2023 as a function of number of years estimated in the model show converging to 1.0 as the number of years increases (Figure \@ref(fig:retroRec2)). Standard deviations of the ratios drop sharply from one year estimated in the model to two years (Figure \@ref(fig:retroRec3)), showing great uncertainty of recruitment estimates for terminal years. Based on these results, we suggest not using recruitment estimates in a terminal year for overfishing/overfished determination.  


### f. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.{-}
i.	Estimated standard deviations of parameters are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:parm-std211b) -- \@ref(tab:parm-std22) for models 21.1b, 22.0, and 23.0a. Estimated standard deviations of mature male biomass are listed in Tables \@ref(tab:est-m211b) -- \@ref(tab:est-m22).   

ii.	Probabilities for mature male biomass and OFL in 2023 were illustrated in Figures X30a-X30b for model 21.1b using the MCMC approach.  

iii.	Probabilities for mature male biomass below the minimum threshold (0.5* B~35%~) in 2023 were plotted in Figure X31 for model 21.1b using the MCMC approach. 

iv.	Sensitivity analysis for handling mortality rate was included in the SAFE report in May 2010. The baseline handling mortality rate for the directed pot fishery was set at 0.2. A 50% reduction and 100% increase respectively resulted in 0.1 and 0.4 as alternatives. Overall, a higher handling mortality rate resulted in slightly higher estimates of mature abundance, and a lower rate resulted in a minor reduction of estimated mature abundance. Differences of estimated legal male abundance and mature male biomass were small for these handling mortality rate changes.   

v.	Sensitivity of weights. Sensitivity of weights was examined in the SAFE report in May 2010. Weights to biomasses (trawl survey biomass, retained catch biomass, and bycatch biomasses) were reduced to 50% or increased to 200% to examine their sensitivity to abundance estimates. Weights to the penalty terms (recruitment variation and sex ratio) were respectively reduced or increased. Overall, estimated biomasses were similar under different weights except during the mid-1970s. The variation of estimated biomasses in the mid-1970s was mainly caused by the changes in estimates of additional mortalities in the early 1980s.


### g. Comparison of alternative model scenarios.{-}
Sensitivity to data weighting comparisons, based on the data through 2010, were reported in the SAFE report in May 2011. Estimating length proportions in the initial year (scenario 1a) resulted in a better fit of survey length compositions at an expense of 36 more parameters than model 1. Abundance and biomass estimates with model 1a were similar between models. Using only standard survey data (scenario 1b) resulted in a poorer fit of survey length compositions and biomass than scenarios using both standard and re-tow data (scenarios 1, 1a, and 1c) and had the lowest likelihood value. Although the likelihood value was higher for using both standard survey and re-tow data for males (scenario 1) than using only standard survey for males (scenario 1c), estimated abundances and biomasses were almost identical. The higher likelihood value for scenario 1 over scenario 1c was due to trawl bycatch length compositions.

In the SAFE report in September 2020, seven models were compared. The population biomass estimates in 2020 were slightly higher than those in 2019. Absolute mature male biomasses for all models had a similar trend over time. Among the seven models, model estimated relative NMFS survey biomasses and mature biomasses were similar, especially for models 19.0a and 19.0b and for models 19.3 and 19.3a. Biomass estimates for models 19.0a and 19.0b were higher during recent years than the other five model scenarios. As expected, model 19.3b estimated a higher trawl survey catchability (>1.0), thus resulting in overall lower absolute biomass estimates. Differences of biomass estimates between models 19.0a and 19.0b and models 19.3, 19.3a, 19.3l, and 19.3h could largely be explained by different structures of natural mortality. All seven models fitted the catch and bycatch biomasses very well. 

The SAFE report in 2021 and 2022 were also focused on the themes of different structures of natural mortality and potential data time series reductions. Additionally, model exploration in May 2023 began explorations on survey catchability estimation, but those are not explored in the models here since they were not deemed appropriate for model selection at this time.  

In this report (September 2023), three models are compared. For negative likelihood value comparisons (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components)), only models 21.1b and 23.0a can be compared since model 22.0 does not have the same data time series. Model 23.0a has a higher negative likelihood value than the base model 21.1b. High base M values estimated inside the models generally result in significantly higher total likelihood values. 

Model 21.1b - which was the accepted model in 2022 - is considred the "base" model for this assessment with only the GMACS version and updated data different from 2022 reported models. Model explorations in May 2023 presented the differences in this model with updates to GMACS in detail. Model 21.1b is used to compare the other two model scenarios, both of which were presented in May 2023 and chosen as potential candidates for specification setting.   

Model 23.0a estimates a base M for males in model 21.1b instead of fixing this base at 0.18. Estimating a base M for males reduces total likelihood compared to model 21.1b, slightly increases annual mature male biomass estimates in most years, and results in an estimated B~35%~ about 10% lower than model 21.1b.  A high M also results in higher F~35%~ and OFL for model 23.0a. The resulting stock status for model 23.0a is very similar to model 21.1b (0.77% of $B_{MSY}$ compared to 0.76%, Table \@ref(tab:specs))

Model 22.0 starts the data time series in 1985, it is the short data version of model 21.1b and the overall results are similar. The notable differences are smaller B35% (19,967 t vs 21,719 t) and NMFS survey catchability (0.94 vs 0.97), and higher OFL (3,917 t vs 3,522 t) for model 22.0. These differences are probably caused by a high recruitment in 1984 (associated with the very large M) being used for B~35%~ computation for model 21.1b and more influence of BSFRF survey data for model 22.0. However, the terminal year estimate of MMB was nearly identical for model 22.0. While this model is appealing due to reductions in parameters estimated and removing the mortality event in the early 80s, the larger retrospective pattern contributes to this model not being the best for characterization of the present and future of this stock and therefore is not recommended for specifications.  

Based on the model results, it appears that the choice of preferred models depends on estimation of M. Considerations of M estimation are whether to estimate a base M for males for the whole time series versus a fixed base M. Model 23.0a estimate M with using a log-normal prior with a mean of 0.18 and a CV of 0.04, which has a fairly tight prior but does result in a higher estimate of M for males and females which appears appropriate for this population. While estimating natural mortality and trawl survey catchability for the entire time series can be confounding, the current priors on both of these estimations are fairly strict and keep them from straying much from their data based means. 

Based on the above considerations, model 21.1b is still recommended (a fixed base M of 0.18 for males) for specification setting for September 2023. However, model 23.0a would be an appropriate step towards a potentially more realistic natural mortality for this stock, and can be considered for specifications also. Ideally it would be good to have a better understanding of the interplay between estimating survey catchabiltiy and natural mortality within this model before moving forward with estimating both. Due to the strict natural of both of the priors in model 23.0a this interplay is minimal. Values for specifications are presented for model 21.1b (Tables \@ref(tab:status) and \@ref(tab:ofl-basis)), but values for the other models are presented in Table \@red(tab:specs).




# F. Calculation of the OFL and ABC{-}
1. Bristol Bay RKC is currently placed in Tier 3b (NPFMC 2007)
2.	For Tier 3 stocks, estimated biological reference points include B~35%~ and F~35%~. Estimated model parameters are used to conduct mature male biomass-per-recruit analysis. 
3.	Specification of the OFL:

The Tier 3 OFL is calculated using the $F_{OFL}$ control rule:

\begin{equation}
F_{OFL} = 
\begin{cases}
0_{directed pot} & \frac{B}{B^{*}} \leq \beta\\[10pt]
F^{*}\frac{(\frac{B}{B^{*}} - \alpha)}{1-\alpha} & \beta < \frac{B}{B^{*}} \leq 1\\[10pt]
F^{*} & \frac{B}{B^{*}} > 1\\[10pt]
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where 

*B* = a measure of the productive capacity of the stock such as spawning biomass or fertilized egg production. A proxy of $B$ is mature male biomass (MMB) estimated at the time of primiparous female mating (February 15). 

$F^{*}$ = $F_{35}$, a proxy for $F_{{MSY}}$, which is a full selection instantaneous $F$ that will produce MSY at the MSY producing biomass.

$B^{*}$ = $B_{35}$, a proxy for $B_{{MSY}}$, which is the value of biomass at the MSY producing level.

$\beta$ = a parameter with restriction that 0 $\leq$ $\beta$ < 1. A default value of 0.25 is used.

$\alpha$ = a parameter with restriction that 0 $\leq$ $\alpha$ $\leq$ $\beta$. A default value of 0.1 is used.

Because trawl bycatch fishing mortality is not related to pot fishing mortality, average trawl bycatch fishing mortality during 2018 to 2022 is used for the per recruit analysis as well as for projections in the next section. Some discards of legal males occurred after the Individual Fishery Quota (IFQ) fishery started in 2005, but the discard rates were much lower during 2007-2013 than in 2005 after the fishing industry minimized discards of legal males. However, due to high proportions of large oldshell males, the discard rate increased greatly in 2014. The current models estimate two levels of retained proportions before 2005 and after 2004. The retained proportions after 2004 and total male selectivities are used to represent current trends for per recruit analysis and projections. Average molting probabilities during 2016-2022 are used for per recruit analysis and projections. For the models in 2023, the averages are the same since they are constant over time during at least the last 15 years.

Average recruitments during 1984-2022 for models starting in 1975 and during 1986-2022 for models starting in 1985 are used to estimate B~35%~ (Figure \@ref(fig:rect2)). Estimated $B_{35}$ is compared with historical mature male biomass in Figure \@ref(fig:stockr). The period of 1984-2022 corresponds to the 1976/77 regime shift, and the recruitment period 1984-present has been used since 2011 to set the overfishing limits. Several factors support our recommendation. First, estimated recruitment was lower after 1983 than before 1984, which corresponded to brood years 1978 and later, after the 1976/77 regime shift. Second, high recruitments during the late 1960s and 1970s generally occurred when the spawning stock was primarily located in the southern Bristol Bay, whereas the recent spawning stock has been concentrated in the middle of Bristol Bay. Oceanic current flows favor larvae hatched in the southern Bristol Bay (see the section on Ecosystem Considerations for SAFE reports in 2008 and 2009). Finally, stock productivity (recruitment/mature male biomass) was higher before the 1976/1977 regime shift. 

The control rule is used for stock status determination. If total catch exceeds OFL estimated at $B$, then “overfishing” occurs. If $B$ equals or declines below 0.5 $B_{{MSY}}$ (i.e., MSST), the stock is “overfished.” If $B/B_{{MSY}}$ or $B/B_{{MSYproxy}}$ equals or declines below $\beta$, then the stock productivity is severely depleted, and the directed fishery is closed. 

The estimated probability distributions of MMB in 2024 are illustrated in Figure 30XX for model 21.1b. Based on SSC suggestions in 2011, $ABC = 0.9*OFL$ and in October 2018, $ABC = 0.8*OFL$. The CPT then recommended $ABC = 0.8*OFL$ in May 2018 (accepted by the SSC), which is used to estimate ABC in this report. Due to the stock being at low levels and the lack of a 2020 survey, the CPT recommended an additional 5% buffer in September 2020, resulting in $ABC = 0.75*OFL$ for 2020. A 20% buffer was suggested by the CPT for 2021 and 2022, and is recommended by the author in 2023 for similar reasons as 2022.

MCMC runs with 500,000 replicates and 500 draws with model 21.1b are used for estimating the probability of estimated mature male biomass being below the minimum threshold $(0.5*B_{35})$ (Figure 31XX). The probability (converted to a percentage) is estimated to be about 0% for model 21.1b (Figure 31XX).

## 2. Research priorities:{-}
a.	Estimating natural mortality,
b.	Estimating crab availability to the trawl surveys,
c.	Surveying juvenile crab abundance in nearshore,
d.	Studying environmental factors that affect the survival rates from larvae to recruitment.

# I. Projections and outlook {-}
## 1. Projections {-}
Future population projections primarily depend on future recruitment, but crab recruitment is difficult to predict. Therefore, annual recruitment for the projections is a random selection from estimated recruitments during 2013-2022, a low recruitment period. Four levels of fishing mortality for the directed pot fishery are used in the projections: 0, 0.083, 0.167 and 0.25. A fishing mortality of 0.167 is similar to the estimated $F_{ofl}$ of 0.173 in 2021 with model 21.1b. MCMC runs with 500,000 replicates and 500 draws are used for the projection.

As expected, projected mature male biomasses are much higher without the directed fishing mortality than under other positive mortality values. At the end of 10 years, projected mature male biomass is below B~35%~ for all models with a fishing mortality of 0.083 or higher due to low recruitments (Figure \@ref(fig:proj-mmb)). Due to the poor recruitment in recent years, the projected biomass is expected to decline during the next few years with a fishing mortality of greater than F = 0.167.

Even though the stock was not overfished in 2022/23, there is still a question whether the stock is “approaching an overfished condition”, which is defined as “when it is projected that there is more than a 50 percent chance that the biomass of the stock or stock complex will decline below the MSST within two years” by the National Standards 1 (NS1). If the stock is not fished more than a fishing mortality of 0.25 for the directed pot fishery in the 2023/2024 and 2024/2025 seasons, the projection using the lowest recruitment periods during 2013-2022 would not likely result in “approaching an overfished condition” for model 21.1b (Figure \@ref(fig:cum-mmbyrs)). With additional low recruitment estimate used to compute B~35%~, the estimated MSST would decline further in 2024. 

The projections are subject to many uncertainties. Constant population parameters estimated in the models used for the projections include M, growth, and fishery selectivities. The uncertainty of abundance and biomass estimates in the terminal year also affects the projections. Uncertainties of the projections caused by these constant parameters and abundance estimates in the terminal year would be reduced by the 20% ABC buffer.  However, if an extreme event occurs, like a sharp increase of M during the projection period, the ABC buffer would be inadequate, and the projections might underestimate uncertainties. The largest uncertainty is likely from recruitments used for the projections. Higher or lower assumed recruitments would cause too optimistic or too pessimistic projections. Overall, recruitments and M used for projections are main factors for projection uncertainties.

## 2. Near Future Outlook {-}
The near future outlook for the Bristol Bay RKC stock is a steady to declining trend. The three recent above-average year classes (hatching years 1990, 1994, and 1997) had entered the legal population by 2006 (Figures \@ref(fig:male-comps) and \@ref(fig:female-comps)). Most individuals from the 1997-year class will continue to gain weight to offset loss of the legal biomass to fishing and natural mortalities. The above-average year class (hatching year 2000) with lengths centered around 87.5 mm CL for both males and females in 2006 and with lengths centered around 112.5-117.5 mm CL for males and around 107.5 mm CL for females in 2008 has largely entered the mature male population in 2009 and the legal population by 2014 (Figures \@ref(fig:male-comps) and \@ref(fig:female-comps)). However, no additional strong cohorts were observed in the survey data after this cohort through 2010 (Figure \@ref(fig:male-comps), \@ref(fig:female-comps), \@ref(fig:male-comps2) and \@ref(fig:female-comps2)). A huge tow of juvenile crab of size 45-55 mm in 2011 was not tracked during 2012-2023 surveys and is unlikely to be a strong cohort. The high survey abundances of large males and mature females in 2014 cannot be explained by the survey data during the previous years and were also inconsistent with the 2016-2022 survey results (Figures \@ref(fig:male-comps2) and \@ref(fig:female-comps2)). Due to lack of recruitment, mature and legal crab may continue to decline next year in the presence of fishing pressure.   

Even with the closed of the directed fishery the past two seasons both recruitment and abundance of male and female crab have held steady, showing only small increases or decreases, and without evidence of better recruitment. The increase in females in this years survey would be promising, but it is confounded by the contribution of one large tow to the increase instead of an increased catch throughout Bristol Bay.  Current crab abundance is still low relative to the late 1970s, and without favorable environmental conditions, recovery to the high levels of the late 1970s is unlikely. 

Although mature crab abundance in Bristol Bay has declined in recent years, mature crab abundance and biomass north of Bristol Bay has been generally stable during last 16 years (Figures \@ref(fig:northBB1M) and \@ref(fig:northBB2F)). Overall, the proportions of different size groups of the Northern RKC during a recent dozen years are higher than in the past and do not trend higher except for mature females in 2021. The high survey mature female abundance in the Northern area in 2021 was primarily from three tows and one of them is more than 50% of total mature females. The survey abundance of the Northern RKC will continue to be provided in figures in the SAFE report in the future. After migration patterns between BBRKC and the Northern RKC are more fully understood, we will examine their relationships and model them in the stock assessment.
