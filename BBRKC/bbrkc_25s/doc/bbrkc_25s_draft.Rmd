# Summary {-}
The model explorations presented here include some of those suggested by CPT and SSC, and updates to GMACS. All GMACS updates were tested to ensure model fit (likelihood values, output, etc.) matched the last accepted base model from September 2024 (model 24.0c GMACS version 2.20.20, 2025-01-30). These models focus on cleaning up the code and a small dip into selectivity - specifically assumptions for selectivity using the BSFRF data as a prior. The work presented here are the beginning of work to explore these topics and the author acknowledges that further exploration is warranted.

The results of these model explorations are presented in this document in section C. Background on the Bristol Bay red king crab modeling approach, modeling framework (GMACS), and history of the stock and fisheries can be found in the last full SAFE published on the NPFMC website and will not be repeated here.

# B. Responses to SSC and CPT  {-}

## CPT and SSC Comments on Assessments in General {-}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

**Response to SSC Comments (June 2024, Oct 2024):**

*"The SSC suggests ... guidance for constructing and interpreting jitter analyses..."*

Response: The CPT plans to review this guidance and establish some SOPs for jitter analysis interpretation at the May 2025 CPT meeting, the author will follow this guidance for Sept. 2025 models.

*"The SSC would like to see additional residual diagnostics other than raw residuals for length composition data from GMACS models. The SSC encourages crab authors to collaborate with ground fish assessment authors regarding the use of One-Step-Ahead and Pearson residuals."*

Response: One-Step-Ahead residuals were discussed at the Jan 2025 modeling workshop and are being incorporated into GMACS output figures for use in assessment output.

*"The SSC requests that the CPT consider whether distinguishing between full and update assessments, ..., would be useful for crab assessments."*

Response: The CPT has not yet taken up this topic.

*"The SSC suggests the CPT live link assessments and other documents in their report to facilitate review."*

Response: This will be taken into consideration in spring reports and full SAFEs.

*"The SSC reiterates the request for the CPT to develop a process to ensure the authors have provided responses to all previous SSC recommendations."*

Response: The CPT has developed a google sheet to track requests, further action maybe discussed at the May 2025 meeting.

*"The SSC requests the authors and CPT consider coordinating the approach to analyzing the Bering Sea Fisheries Research Foundation (BSFRF) data for two Chionoecetes crab and Bristol Bay red king crab (BBRKC) stocks, and specifically consider developing the results as a prior on selectivity for use in the models. "*

Response: There was some discussion among authors Jan 2025 modeling workshop, which corresponded to Buck Stockhausen work on this topic. The CPT has not developed a coordinated approach yet to this topic. 

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}


**Response to SSC Comments (June 2023, Oct 2023):**
     
*"The SSC recommends that a "fallback" Tier 4 alternative be provided, as recommended by the Simpler Modeling workshop. When doing so the SSC asks the authors to provide plots to compare OFLs with the status quo Tier 3 models for previous years, justification for the time series used for status determination and a recommended ABC buffer."*

Response: A Tier 4 fallback based on survey data and the REMA model was provided in fall of 2024 and will be provided this Sept. 

*"For the inclusion of trawl survey data, the SSC suggests crab assessment authors and the CPT be more explicit about best practices for which standard years are included for bottom trawl survey data."*

Response: This was addressed by the CPT at our Jan 2024 meeting. See meeting minutes for agreed upon "best practices".

*"The SSC recommends the crab stocks begin using the established risk table format from groundfish for assessing uncertainty around buffer considerations"*

Response: After viewing draft risk tables in Sept. 2024 the CPT decided to pick up a risk table format for crab stock discussion at the May 2025 meeting. The risk table framework agreed upon at this meeting will be presented with final assessments in Sept. 2025. 


*"The SSC recommends that uncertainty intervals be included when showing time series of biomass/abundance estimated by models.*

Response: These are provided in this document.

## CPT and SSC Comments on BBRKC assessment {-}
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
**Responses to SSC Comments (June 2024/Oct 2024):**

*"The SSC recommends that the author bring forward a model that adds the BSFRF prior on selectivity for the 2025 assessment."*

Response: Models 25.1a, 25.1b, and 25.1b2 all use the BSFRF data as a prior on selectivity. The author has concerns over moving to these models without further model exploration for the 2025 assessment and this is discussed in this document.

*"The SSC agrees with the additional considerations by the CPT in their minutes prioritizing; 1) considerations of selectivity time periods based on gear types and 2) considerations of time-varying selectivity in the fishery data relative to the survey data."*

Response: The selectivity models presented in this document do retain the two time block for survey selectivity for the NMFS time series. However, the author has not yet explored time-varying selectivity in the fishery data relative to the survey data and hopes to have some discussion with the CPT on what this exploration could look like. 

*"The SSC reiterates its request to evaluate whether crab biomass and fishing mortality in the northern district should be included."*

Response: Since 2022 the SAFE document has tracked Northern RKC data from the NMFS trawl survey. Overall, the proportions of different size/sex groups of the Northern RKC during a recent dozen years are higher than in the past and do not trend higher except for mature females in 2021. The high survey mature female abundance in the Northern area in 2021 was primarily from three tows and one of them is more than 50% of total mature females. The survey abundance of the Northern RKC will continue to be plotted in the SAFE report in the future. After migration patterns between BBRKC and the Northern RKC are fully understood, we will model them in the stock assessment.
An assessment model that includes crab outside the Bristol Bay boundary would have to include updates to data inputs for all catch and survey time series, and also include conversations with managers on the implications of a larger spatial model. Explorations into model based indices for other Bering Sea stocks may provide an option for BBRKC to utilize the Northern district crab to design a model based index that only predicts over the traditional Bristol Bay grid. Work on this is planned for 2025/2026. 


*"The SSC recommends the author revisit previous CPT discussion and rationale on whether 50% handling mortality is appropriate for both pot and longline (fixed gear) gear and to provide additional information in the next assessment."*

Response: Model 24.0c.1a presented in this document (May 2025) includes a model run with a 20% handling mortality in place of the historical 50%. No measurable changes to model results were observed (**fix**), likely due to the small magnitude of fixed gear catch in the model compared to directed fishery catch. Ultimately a change in the handling mortality rate for fixed gear would have to be approved by the CPT. A review of the data available to inform handling mortality estimations occurred at the May 2022 CPT meeting ([**HM May 2022**](https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=000d775c-1ef7-487b-98a7-47c4ce8bfb9b.pdf&fileName=PPT_HM%20rates%20GF%20Fisheries.pdf)). At this time there are no direct research studies conducted on mortality of crab caught as bycatch in the longline or pot groundfish fisheries. Historically ranges of 30 to 50% have been use din various Council analyses and since 2008 a 50% rate has been applied when splitting bycatch between fixed and trawl gear. 

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2024):** 
  
*"Including BSFRF as a ‘ghost fleet’ as a check on model behavior."*
  
Response: Further exploration of the BSFRF data and its use in the BBRKC model is needed and planned for 2025/2026, it was not able to be examined prior to May 2025.

*Split the selectivity into eras to reflect the change in survey gear, but still use the same priors, perhaps with larger CVs in the early era.*

Response: Models 25.1a, 25.1b, and 25.1b2 all retain the time block for survey selectivity estimation and use the same priors for both periods. Model 25.1b2 has larger CVs for both eras, but this resulted in the same estimation as Model 25.1b.

*Selectivity and retention explorations that may include: exploring parameters that allow for the retention curve to asymptote below one, exploring splines for selectivity, and exploring models using time-varying selectivity to better understand model dynamics.*

Response: Model sensitivity to selectivity and retention assumption should be explored but was not prioritized this year. Further direction from the CPT on hypotheses for these model runs would help in determining the appropriate parameterizations to explore moving forward.


*Explore including larger size bins in the model to explore dome shaped selectivity.*

Response: Including larger size bins than the current model uses (>160mm for males specifically) would require re-visiting the growth matrix for this stock. This matrix has been established for some time and would require some historic data recovery to determine if larger size bin growth could be determined from the same data. To include larger size bins assumptions would need to be made for the growth matrix unless the historic data was recoverable. 
Additionally, raw data to add size bins to each of the size comp data sets is still in the process but an initial look at the NMFS data to determine if larger size bins should be incorporate was explored here. Figure xx displays the distribution of size composition for all years of the NMFS data and the associated lower and upper cut offs for the model. Initial exploration does not suggest a large change in size distribution over time, at least for the last 15 years.

knitr::include_graphics("figures/size_comp_over_time_all.png", dpi = 200)
```


*Remove shell condition from the model since it's not being used currently*

Response: Shell condition was removed from the model code, reflected as model 24.0c.2, has has no measurable effect on results since it was not being used in the model.

\newpage
\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

**Response to SSC Comments specific to this assessment (from October 2023):**
  
*Provide basis for the tight prior on M and catchability.*
  
  Response: The prior on trawl survey catchability is estimated with a mean of 0.896 and a standard deviation of 0.025 (CV about 0.03) that is based on double-bag experiment results (Weinberg et al. 2004). The prior on M is based on the balance of allowing M to be estimated above the default, historic 0.18 value for males but realizing the limitations of the data to estimate M freely. Future work is planned and will continue to explore the most appropriate estimation of M.

*Consider tracking Dungeness crab abundance in the EBS and how this might affect BBRKC dynamics.*
  
  Response: Currently there is no abundance estimate of Dungeness crab in the EBS. Conversations have occurred between the author and regional biologist on possible general affects, with the overall consensus that these two species are likely not occupying the same habitat as juveniles/adults. However, the early life spatial occupation for both of these stocks is unknown, so there may be competition for food in these stages. Trends of Dungeness catch over time are being obtained and will be explored in future work.

*Explain why equal sample sizes are used for male and female size composition data.*
  
  Response: The size composition data for surveys is entered into the model as aggregate data since they are derived from the same survey samples. Therefore the sample size for each is based on the total number of crab measured not those measured by sex. 

*MCMC output diagnostics, autocorrelation plots and parameter chains*
  
  Response: These will be provided in Sept 2025 when a full MCMC is performed on the preferred models. The CPT will have discussions in May 2025 on the suite of diagnostics to report for MCMC output.

*Possible effect of high 2011 recruitment as scene in survey size composition figures*
  
  Response: Size composition plots in Sept 2023 highlighted a potential recruitment event in 2011 for both males and females from the NMFS survey data (Figures 6 and 7 - Sept 2023 SAFE). This peak occurs as size classes that are not included in the assessment model (< 65mm, figures 43 and 44 - Sept 2023 SAFE), therefore this recruitment likely plays little role in the model estimates and resulting retrospective pattern since it is not seen in subsequent years to be included in the model. 

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

**Response to CPT Comments (from May 2023 / Sept 2023):** 
  
*Reconsider which growth parameters are estimated vs. specified. Consider a model run with growth specified outside the model (CPT Sept 2023)*
  
  Response: The author is collaborating with biologists on the availability of more recent growth data, and investigating the feasibility of recovering the original raw data used in the historic growth specifications. Work is underway to determine the best path forward for growth parameterizations for this stock. 

*Survey selectivity / q / catchability. Reconsider the strong prior and shape of the selectivity curve. Consider using the BSFRF data as a prior on selectivity/catchability as was done in the snow crab assessment (CPT and SSC May/June 2023 and Sept/Oct 2023)*
  
  Response: Models presented in May 2024 (24.0 and 24.0b) reflected explorations on using the BSFRF data as a prior on selectivity - similar to snow crab (fall 2023). Further explorations on priors and shape were not explored this round, although the previous assessment author did explore some aspects in models runs between 2020 and 2022.

*Revisit blocking on molting probability from tagging data (CPT and SSC May/June 2023)*
  
  Response: The blocking of molt probability for males reflects changes in the Bristol Bay ecosystem in the early 80s and has been a historic component of the current model. Models 24.0c and 24.0d reflect removing this blocking to estimate one molting probability for the entire time series. Model 24.0c was adopted in Fall of 2024.

# C. Modeling Approaches and Explorations for spring 2025{-}


## Assessment Methodology {-}

This assessment model uses the GMACS modeling framework (since 2019) and is detailed in Appendix A of the last full SAFE report (link in the summary section).
An updated version of GMACS (version 2.20.20, 2025-01-30) was used. The fall 2024 assessment used version 2.20.14, 2024-05-20. Progress of GMACS development has been documented on the GitHub development site ([GMACS GitHub](https://github.com/GMACS-project?view_as=public)).

## Model explorations{-}
Models explored in this document:

  - **24.0c**:          base model (fall 2024), M for males estimated in the model, molt time block removed + updated GMACS 
  - **24.0c.1**:        24.0c + updated catch time series data for crab fisheries via ADF&G
  - **24.0c.1a**:       24.0c.1 + 20% handling mortality for fixed gear 
  - **24.0c.2**:        24.0c.1 + removing shell condition placeholders from code
  - **25.1a**:          24.0c.2 + selectivity informed by BSFRF survey all data
  - **25.1b**:          24.0c.2 + selectivity informed by BSFRF survey SBS subset of data 
  - **25.1b2**:         25.1b + increased sd on selectivity prior for each size bin

### Reasoning for model explorations {-}
Six model scenarios are presented in this report. The first set of models are updated to the base model that reflect code clean up (model 24.0c.2), data changes, and sensitivities to fixed gear handling mortality. For these model runs the overall model fit is nearly identical, including the MLE and likelihood components (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components)), which is expected due to the minimal changes. 

The rest of the model scenarios explore using a prior on selectivity that is defined from the BSFRF data similar to snow crab models in 2023 (models 25.1a, 25.1b, and 25.1b2), building on previous models presented in May of 2024. These models use model 24.0c.2 as the base model, which it the 2024 accepted base model with updated data and code clean up (this model estimates the base M for males using a log-normal prior with a mean of 0.18 and a CV of 0.04, has no time block for molt probability, has updated catch data, and included code cleanups related to shell condition).  

Recent CPT/SSC comments and the simpler modeling workshop report suggested that the author should explore methods to estimate catchability (*Q*) for the NMFS trawl survey. In the base models, initial trawl survey catchability is estimated to be 0.896 with a standard deviation of 0.025 (CV about 0.03) that is based on double-bag experiment results (Weinberg et al. 2004). The appropriateness of this prior and the relationship between NMFS trawl survey *Q* and that assumed for the BSFRF survey have been on the list of model suggestions. 

Model explorations here use methods similar to those for snow crab in 2023 to explore using the BSFRF data as a prior on selectivity for the NMFS survey. BSFRF surveys were performed in 5 years (2007, 2008, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016) and are currently treated as a separate index in the assessment model, with both the index and size composition data being fit with the *Q* for BSFRF set to 1.  Models 25.1a, 25.1b, and 25.1b2 (based on the base model 24.0c.2) remove the BSFRF data as an index and size composition data set and instead use the information from these data to set a normal prior on selectivity for the NMFS survey. A GAM was fit to inferred selectivity (assuming the catchability of the BSFRF survey was 1) at size by year weighted by the sample size by year (gam(sel~s(size), weights= sample_size)). For these purposes males and females were combined as one sample. 

This analysis was performed on two data sets; the first used all of the size composition data for each survey for all years (2007, 2008, and 2013 to 2016), and the second was a subset of this data that included only the side-by-side haul data for the years in which the author had it available (2013 to 2016). The predicted means and standard errors of the resulting GAMs was input as a prior on a selectivity parameter for each size class in GMACS (Figure \@ref(fig:exploreS) and \@ref(fig:exploreS2)). Specifically in GMACS parametrization, the selectivity type was set to 0 (parametric) in the .ctl file and catchability was fixed at 1. Model 25.1a uses all of the size composition data and is similar to the May 2024 model presented (Figure \@ref(fig:exploreS), while models 25.1b and 25.1b2 use the side-by-side subset of data (Figure \@ref(fig:exploreS2)). Model 25.1b2 doubles the standard error associated with each size bins estimation in an unsucessful attempt to explore variability.


## Results {-}


### a. Sensitivity to data and code clarification changes {-}
Models 24.0c, 24.0c.1, 24.0c.1a, and 24.0c.2 reflect updates to the directed catch time series (model 24.0c1), code clean up related to historic use of shell condition (model 24.0c.2), and sensitivities to handling mortality in the fixed gear groundfish fisheries (model 24.0c.1a). The likelihoods for these model comparisons are nearly identical (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components)). Base on these results adopting the new catch data and the code clean up are consist with improved base model practices, therefore model 24.0c.2 was used as the updated base model for further explorations. 
Changes to the handling mortality rate for fixed gear groundfish bycatch was performed as a model sensitivity as requested by stakeholders and the SSC. Changes to the handling mortality rate would have to be adopted by the CPT before this was put into place in the base model data input. 


### b. Effective sample sizes and weighting factors {-}
- CVs are assumed to be 0.03 for retained catch biomass, 0.04 for total male biomass, 0.07 for pot bycatch biomasses, 0.10 for groundfish bycatch biomasses, and 0.23 for recruitment sex ratio. Models also estimate sigmaR for recruitment variation and have a penalty on M variation and many prior-densities.     
- Initial trawl survey catchability (Q) is estimated to be 0.896 with a standard deviation of 0.025 (CV about 0.03) based on the double-bag experiment results (Weinberg et al. 2004). These values are used to set a prior for estimating Q in models with both the BSFRF and NMFS data, but not in the 25.0 series of models explored.
Refer to the 2024 completed SAFE document for further information on this section.

### b. Tables of estimates {-}
- Negative log-likelihood values are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components) for all models, while parameter estimates are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:parm-std24c) -- \@ref(tab:parm-std251b)  for a few representative models.
- Natural mortality estimates are shown in Table \@ref(tab:Natmort).
- Abundance, MMB, and recruitment time series for a few representative models are found in Tables \@ref(tab:est-m24c) -- \@ref(tab:est-m251b). 

### c. Evaluation of the fit to the data and model estimates.{-}
- Selectivities by length (Figures \@ref(fig:sel1) and \@ref(fig:sel2))

Model explorations focus on estimated trawl survey selectivity. The use of the BSFRF data as a prior on survey selectivity in models 25.1a and 25.1b resulted in a difference in selectivity, especially for large size bins. However, the overall shape of the selectivity curve for these models is similar to that estimated in the base model. Survey selectivity affects not only the fitting of the data but also the absolute abundance estimates. These estimated survey selectivities are generally smaller than the capture probabilities in Figure A1 (refer to last full SAFE draft) because survey selectivities include capture probabilities and crab availability. The NMFS survey catchability (*Q*) is estimated to be 0.896 from the trawl experiment. The reliability of estimated survey selectivities will greatly affect the application of the model to fisheries management since under- or over-estimates of survey selectivities will cause a systematic upward or downward bias of abundance estimates, respectively. 

- NMFS trawl survey biomass and BSFRF surveys (Figures \@ref(fig:surv1) -- \@ref(fig:surv1c)).

Among the model scenarios, model estimated NMFS survey biomasses are similar, with some changed in scale due to changes in *Q*, which is expected.  

The fit to BSFRF survey data are similar among the models in the base comparison series as expected due to the small difference in these models.

All models fits the catch and bycatch biomasses very well and similarly so they are not presented in this document. 

- Recruitment (Figures \@ref(fig:rect1) and \@ref(fig:rect2))

Recruitment time series are plotted for all model scenarios in groups of like models - base models and selectivity models. Recruitment is estimated at the end of year in GMACS. Estimated recruitment time series are generally similar in trends for all models, with those models that use the BSFRF data to estimate selectivity having a difference in the recruitment scale to match the overall scaling of abundance to match the estimated selectivity. 

- Fishing mortality (Figure \@ref(fig:fmort))

The full fishing mortalities for the directed pot fishery at the time of fishing are plotted against mature male biomass on Feb. 15 in the last full SAFE (See BBRKC 2024 SAFE link and Figures 26, 27, and 29). Estimated fishing mortalities in most years before the current harvest strategy was adopted in 1996 were above F35%. Under the current harvest strategy, estimated fishing mortalities were at or above the F35% limits in 1998, 2007-2009, and 2014-2019 for model 24.0c.2, but below the F35% limits in the other post-1995 years. 

Estimated fishing mortalities for pot female and groundfish fisheries bycatches are generally small and less than 0.07 (not shown in this document but available in last full SAFE). 

- Estimated mature male biomass (Figures \@ref(fig:mmb1), and \@ref(fig:mmb2))

Estimated mature male biomass for all models has a similar trend over time, however the scaling of the biomass is highly dependent, as expected, on estimates of *Q* in the models. Higher estimated selectivity for a majority of size classes in models 25.1a and 25.1b results in a lower overall scale for mature male biomass compared to the base model. These models are consistently lower in overall scale from about 1990 onward.

- Size composition fits by length and residual plots (Figures  \@ref(fig:sc-pot) -- \@ref(fig:sc-res-bubble-male-nmfs)).

All models fit the length composition data similarly and well. Modal progressions are tracked well in the trawl survey data, particularly beginning in mid-1990s. Cohorts first seen in the trawl survey data in 1975, 1986, 1990, 1995, 1999, 2002 and 2005 can be tracked over time. Bycatch size composition data provide little information to track modal progression and are not displayed graphically.
**fix**Pearson residuals of proportions of survey males and females appear to be random over length and year for all models, however models with higher base M - models based on 23.0a - improve the plus group fittings slightly.   

### d. Retrospective and historical analyses {-}
Retrospective analysis was not performed on these model explorations. Topics explored in these models were not expected to improved retrospective trends and therefore these were not explored at this time. They will be performed on models for the fall full SAFE. Retrospective runs performed for the 2023 SAFE suggested an improvement with estimation of M for males, as reported in the Mohn's rho values, from a Mohn's $rho$ of 0.373 to 0.226. The improved retrospective pattern in MMB was one of the reasons the model with estimation of a base M value for males was approaved in 2023. Model explorations since 2023 have not improved the retrospective patterns. 


### e. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.{-}
- Estimated standard deviations of parameters are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:parm-std24c) -- \@ref(tab:parm-std251b) for a few representative models. 

- The last completed SAFE document in 2024 details uncertainty estimates in the current base model parameterization ([**BBRKC 2024 SAFE**](https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=7b8e95ba-6182-4a34-b141-92b0f13f5a07.pdf&fileName=BBRKC%20SAFE%202024.pdf)).



### f. Comparison of alternative model scenarios.{-}
In this report (May 2025), six models are presented. Three of which were not expected to have large changes in model fit or likelihood values. For negative likelihood value comparisons (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components)), the base model comparisons (models 24.0c, 24.0c.1, 24.0c.1a, and 24.0c.2) were nearly identical, which was expected since they reflected data updates, GMACS updates, and had no structural model changes. Model 24.0c.2 should be considered the most correct reference model and was used to compare other model explorations. 

Models 25.1a, 25.1b, and 25.1b2 explore the use of the BSFRF survey data as an informed prior on selectivity for NMFS instead of treating these data as another index/size composition. This approach was similar to that used for snow crab in 2023, and is considered a initial approach at this line of exploration. For these model runs two versions of the BSFRF data sets were used, with the first using overall catch and size composition data from both surveys in all years with data, and the second using a subset of only the side-by-side haul data which is a reduction in sample size and year range. The use of the GAM model estimates for these two data sets as a prior on selectivity in the model was the same, with the same prior information being used for both selectivity time blocks (1975 to 1981, and 1982 to 2023). Model 25.1b2 was run to determine if increasing the error on the prior would change the estimated selectivity curve, but this did not have the desired outcome since the model estimate was nearly identical to model 25.1b. The inferred selectivity patterns estimated using the BSFRF data is similar to that estimated in the base model (Figure  \@ref(fig:exploreS) and \@ref(fig:exploreS2)). 

Figure \@ref(fig:sel2) visualizes the estimated relationship using the estimated inferred selectivity from the BSFRF data as a prior. Compared to the base model these models have small increases in selectivity for most size bins and the potential for variable relationship at larger size bins greater than 130 mm carapace length. These models, as current specified, do not reflect improvement in overall model fit. However, variants of this approach should be considered for exploration in the future. Further model explorations are warranted for exploring selectivity and catchability in this model. and the authors would appreciate guidance on potential next steps. Additionally, if the BSFRF data were used as a prior, a more appropriate method to incorporate those data is needed since the method used here ignores correlation among size bins in estimating parameters for selectivity. 

Based on the above considerations, the authors are hesitant to recommend any of the selectivity alternatives for setting specification for this fall. The updated base model will be brought forward, model 24.0c.2, and the author can also bring forward alternatives that incorporate changes to fixed gear groundfish handling mortalities if the crab plan team would like to consider those. The author is open to plan team discussion and thoughts on the status of the BSFRF selectivity prior models but is cautious to make changes in selectivity estimate due to concern over how the parameterization is currently performed (lack of correlation between size bins) and the ramifications on population scaling. The author suggests that further work is needed on explorations for selectivity and catchability before variants of models 25.1a and 25.1b should be considered for specification setting. 

The CPT/SSC comments above address many other topics that were not able to be addressed in this round of model improvements but are on the author's list for consideration. Some of these topics require more extensive data mining and time prioritization than is currently allotted in the authors current workplan. Additionally, the author is currently pursuing analyses to assist the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in updating the State harvest strategy and will update on progress on that front when appropriate in the Council process.

# E. Projections and Future Outlook {-}
Projections into the future will be performed in the Sept. 2025 assessment with the models selected from this document.

The projections are subject to many uncertainties. Constant population parameters estimated in the models used for the projections include M, growth, and fishery selectivities. The uncertainty of abundance and biomass estimates in the terminal year also affects the projections. Uncertainties of the projections caused by these constant parameters and abundance estimates in the terminal year would be reduced by the 20% ABC buffer.  However, if an extreme event occurs, like a sharp increase of M during the projection period, the ABC buffer would be inadequate, and the projections might underestimate uncertainties. The largest uncertainty is likely from recruitment used for the projections. Higher or lower assumed recruitment would cause too optimistic or too pessimistic projections. Overall, recruitment and M used for projections are main factors for projection uncertainties.
