Model 3  - "time" blocks for q for the pot survey

Examine the residuals for the pot survey from the base model - see figure: cpue_pot_residuals.png

No great pattern in the residuals with the exception of 2015 - 2018 - these are all negative.

Ideas:

a. q for 1995- 2013, q for 2015-2018
**maybe** b. q 1995, 1998, 2001; q for 2004; q for 2007 to 2013; q for 2015-2018

start with these, simple vs. extreme

Changes are needed to the .dat and .ctl files

a.Jie had suggested a normal prior instead of a uniform one. same initial value for both (0.003) normal prior (0.1 ?)

conclusion: decided to just run with model 3a. Going to get CPT feedback before exploring more time block options. Not sure how helpful these are.  Overall ssb is the same as base model, but recruitment maybe a little higher in last 2 years.
