# Executive Summary {-}
1. **Stock**: Blue king crab, *Paralithodes platypus*, Saint Matthew Island (SMBKC), Alaska.

2. **Catches**: Peak historical harvest was 4,288 t (9.454 million pounds) in 1983/84^[1983/84 refers to a fishing
year that extends from 1 July 1983 to 30 June 1984.]. 
The fishery was closed for 10 years after the stock was declared overfished in 1999. 
Fishing resumed in 2009/10 with a fishery-reported retained catch of 209 t (0.461 million
pounds), less than half the 529.3 t (1.167 million pound) TAC.
Following three more years of modest harvests
supported by a fishery catch per unit effort (CPUE) of around 10 crab per pot lift, the fishery was again closed in
2013/14 due to declining trawl-survey estimates of abundance and concerns about the health of the stock. 
The directed fishery resumed again in 2014/15 with a TAC of 300 t (0.655 million pounds), but the fishery performance was
relatively poor with a retained catch of 140 t (0.309 million pounds). 
The retained catch in 2015/16 was even lower at 48 t (0.105 million pounds) and the fishery has remained closed since 2016/17.

3. **Stock biomass**: The 1978-2019 NMFS trawl survey mean biomass is 5,605 t with the 2019 value being the
15th lowest (3,170 t; the tenth lowest since 2000). 
This 2019 biomass of $\ge$ 90 mm carapace length (CL) male crab is 
57% of the long term mean  at 6.99 million pounds (with a CV of 34%), and an 83% increase from the 2018 biomass.
The most recent 3-year average of the NMFS survey is 40% of the mean value, indicating a decline in biomass compared to
historical survey estimates, notably in 2010 and 2011 that were over four times the current average.
However, the 2019 value is substantially larger than the two previous years (3,170 t compared to 1,731 t in 2018 and 1,794 t in 2017).
The ADFG pot survey did not occur in 2019, but in 2018 the relative biomass in this index was the lowest
in the time series (12% of the mean from the 11 surveys conducted since 1995).
The assessment model estimates tempers this increase and suggests that the stock (in survey biomass units) is presently at about
`r bio_lt_percent `% 
of the long term model-predicted survey biomass average, similar to the last two years. 
The trend from these values suggests a steady state in the last few years, which does not fit the 2019 observed survey data point well.

4. **Recruitment**: Recruitment is based on estimated number of male crab within the 90-104 mm CL size class
in each year. The 2019 trawl-survey area-swept estimate of 0.403 million male SMBKC in this size class is the twelfth lowest in 
the 42 years since 1978 and follows two of the lowest previously observed values in 2017 and 2018. The recent six-year (2014 - 2019) average recruitment is only 47% of the long-term mean. 
In the pot-survey, the abundance of this size group in 2017 was also the second-lowest in the time series (22% of the mean for the 
available pot-survey data) whereas in 2018 the value was the lowest observed at only 10% of the mean value.

5. **Management performance**: In this assessment, estimated total male catch is the sum of fishery-reported retained
catch, estimated male discard mortality in the directed fishery, and estimated male bycatch mortality in the groundfish fisheries.
Based on the reference model for SMBKC, the estimate for mature male biomass was below the minimum stock-size threshold (MSST) in 2018/19 and is in an "overfished" condition, despite fishery closures in the last three years 
(and hence overfishing has not occurred) (Tables \@ref(tab:status), \@ref(tab:ofl-basis), and \@ref(tab:management-quants)). 
Computations which indicate the relative impact of fishing 
(i.e., the "dynamic $B_0$") suggests, that the current spawning stock biomass has been reduced to `r .get_dynB0_df(Mbase) %>% transmute(round(100*ssb,0)) %>% slice(n())`% of what it would have been in the absence of fishing, assuming the same level of recruitment as estimated.

6. **Basis for the OFL**: Estimated mature-male biomass (MMB) on 15 February is used as the measure of 
 biomass for this Tier 4 stock, with males measuring $\ge$ 105 mm CL considered mature. 
 The $B_\mathit{MSY}$ proxy is obtained by averaging estimated MMB over a specific reference period, and current CPT/SSC guidance recommends using the full assessment time frame as the default reference period. 
 Both the full time frame and the current regime are presented here for consideration for 2019/20.

# A. Summary of Major Changes {-}

## Changes in Management of the Fishery {-}

There are no new changes in management of the fishery.

## Changes to the Input Data {-}

Data used in this assessment have been updated to include the most recently
available fishery and survey numbers. This assessment includes of one new
survey data point - the 2019 NMFS trawl-survey estimate of abudance. 
The triennial ADF&G pot survey was not conducted in 2019. 
The NMFS trawl-surveys have associated size
compositon data. The assessment also uses updated 2010-2018 groundfish and
fixed gear bycatch estimates based on NMFS Alaska Regional Office (AKRO) data. 
The directed fishery has been closed since 2016/17, so no recent fishery data are available.

## Changes in Assessment Methodology {-}

This assessment uses the General model for Alasks crab stocks (Gmacs) framework. The
model is configured to track three stages of length categories and was 
first presented in May 2011 by W.Gaeuman, ADF&G, per.com. and accepted by the CPT in May 2012. 
A difference from the original approach and that used here is that natural and fishing mortalities are
continuous within `r M[[ref_mod]]$nseason` discrete seasons (using the appropriate
catch equation rather than assuming an applied pulse removal). Season length in Gmacs
is controlled by changing the proportion of natural mortality that is applied
each season. 
Diagnostic output includes estimates of the "dynamic $B_0$" which simply
computes the ratio of the estimated spawning biomass relative to the spawning biomass that would have occurred 
had there been no historical fishing mortality. 
Details of this implementation and other model details are provided in Appendix A.

## Changes in Assessment Results {-}

Both surveys indicate a decline over the past few years. The "reference" model is that which was selected for use in 2018.
There is only one new data set to be included this year so this becomes the updated reference model. 
Two alternative models are presented to assess sensitivity to the model, while another is provided for alternative reference point calculations (Table \@ref(tab:ofl-basis)) using a recent regime time frame. The **fit survey** configuration simply adds emphasis on the design-based survey data (by assuming a lower input variance). The **add CV pot** configuration estimates an additional CV on the pot survey data, which in turn allows the model to fit the trawl-survey estimates better. 


# B. Responses to SSC and CPT  {-}

## CPT and SSC Comments on Assessments in General {-}


Comment: *Regarding general code development, the SSC and CPT outstanding requests continue to be as follows:*

  1. *add the ability to conduct retrospective analyses*

     Progress was limited in implementing this feature. We will conduct a retrospective analysis within the next year.
     
  2. *Continued exploration of data weighting (Francis and other approaches) and evaluation of models with and without the 1998 natural mortality spike. The authors are encouraged to bring other models forward for CPT and SSC consideration*
  
     We continued with the iterative re-weighting for composition data.

Comment: *Breakpoint analysis for reference point time frames that does not rely on stock-recruit relationship*
  
  We applied the STARS method to the recruitment time series, Appendix C. 
  
Comment: *Regarding rebuilding projection specifications and options, the SSC and CPT requests are:*

  1. *bring forth reference points for status determination for both regim time frames*
  
     See reference point table (Table \@ref(tab:ofl-basis)). Completed

  2. *bring forth projections 1 and 5 from the May CPT, both with mean recruitment 1) current time frame (1978-2018) and 2) breakpt time period (1996-2018)*
  
     Completed. Refer to Appendix C.


# C. Introduction {-}

## Scientific Name {-}

The blue king crab is a lithodid crab, *Paralithodes platypus* (Brant 1850).

## Distribution {-}

Blue king crab are sporadically distributed throughout the North Pacific Ocean from Hokkaido, Japan, to southeastern
Alaska (Figure \@ref(fig:distribution)).  In the eastern Bering Sea small populations are distributed around St. Matthew
Island, the Pribilof Islands, St. Lawrence Island, and Nunivak Island. Isolated populations also exist in some other
cold water areas of the Gulf of Alaska (NPFMC 1998). The St. Matthew Island Section for blue king crab is within Area Q2
(Figure \@ref(fig:registration)), which is the Northern District of the Bering Sea king crab registration area and
includes the waters north of Cape Newenham (58&deg;39' N. lat.) and south of Cape Romanzof (61&deg;49' N. lat.).

## Stock Structure {-}

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) Gene Conservation Laboratory, has detected regional population
differences between blue king crab collected from St. Matthew Island and the Pribilof Islands^[NOAA grant Bering Sea
Crab Research II, NA16FN2621, 1997.]. 
The NMFS tag-return data from studies on blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands and
St. Matthew Island support the idea that legal-sized males do not migrate between the two areas (Otto and Cummiskey
1990). St. Matthew Island blue king crab tend to be smaller than their Pribilof conspecifics, and the two stocks are
managed separately.

## Life History {-}

Like the red king crab, *Paralithodes camtshaticus*, the blue king crab is considered a shallow water species by
comparison with other lithodids such as golden king crab, *Lithodes aequispinus*, and the scarlet king crab, 
*Lithodes couesi* (Donaldson and Byersdorfer 2005). Adult male blue king crab are found at an average depth of 70 m (NPFMC 1998).
The reproductive cycle appears to be annual for the first two reproductive cycles and biennial thereafter (Jensen
and Armstrong 1989), and mature crab seasonally migrate inshore where they molt and mate. Unlike red king crab, juvenile
blue king crab do not form pods, but instead rely on cryptic coloration for protection from predators and require
suitable habitat such as cobble and shell hash. Somerton and MacIntosh (1983) estimated SMBKC male size at sexual
maturity to be 77 mm carapace length (CL). Paul et al. (1991) found that spermatophores were present in the vas deferens
of 50% of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab males examined with sizes of 40-49 mm CL and in 100% of the males at
least 100 mm CL. Spermataphore diameter also increased with increasing CL with an asymptote at ~ 100 mm CL. It was noted,
however, that although spermataphore presence indicates physiological sexual maturity, it may not be an indicator of
functional sexual maturity. For purposes of management of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab fishery, the State of
Alaska uses 105 mm CL to define the lower size bound of functionally mature males (Pengilly and Schmidt 1995). Otto and
Cummiskey (1990) report an average growth increment of 14.1 mm CL for adult SMBKC males.

## Management History {-}

The SMBKC fishery developed subsequent to baseline ecological studies associated with oil exploration (Otto 1990). Ten
U.S. vessels harvested 545 t (1.202 million pounds) in 1977, and harvests peaked in 1983 when 164 vessels landed 4,288 t
(9.454 million pounds) (Fitch et al. 2012; Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-fishery)).

The fishing seasons were generally short, often lasting only a few days. The fishery was declared overfished and closed
in 1999 when the stock biomass estimate was below the minimum stock-size threshold (MSST) of 4,990 t (11.0 million
pounds) as defined by the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands King and Tanner crabs (NPFMC
1999). Zheng and Kruse (2002) hypothesized a high level of SMBKC natural mortality from 1998 to 1999 as an explanation
for the low catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the 1998/99 commercial fishery and the low numbers across all male crab size
groups caught in the annual NMFS eastern Bering Sea trawl survey from 1999 to 2005 (see survey data in next section). In
November 2000, Amendment 15 to the FMP for Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands king and Tanner crabs was approved to implement a
rebuilding plan for the SMBKC stock (NPFMC 2000). The rebuilding plan included a State of Alaska regulatory harvest strategy 
(*5 AAC 34.917*), area closures, and gear modifications. In addition, commercial crab fisheries near St. Matthew Island were
scheduled in fall and early winter to reduce the potential for bycatch mortality of vulnerable molting and mating crab.

NMFS declared the stock rebuilt on 21 September 2009, and the fishery was reopened after a 10-year closure on 15 October
2009 with a TAC of 529 t (1.167 million pounds), closing again by regulation on 1 February 2010. Seven participating
vessels landed a catch of 209 t (0.461 million pounds) with a reported effort of 10,697 pot lifts and an estimated CPUE of
9.9 retained individual crab per pot lift. The fishery remained open the next three years with modest harvests and
similar CPUE, but large declines in the NMFS trawl-survey estimate of stock abundance raised concerns about the health
of the stock. This prompted ADF&G to close the fishery again for the 2013/14 season. 
The fishery was reopened for the 2014/15 season with a low TAC of 297 t (0.655 million pounds) and in 2015/16 the TAC
was further reduced to 186 t (0.411 million pounds) then completely closed the 2016/17 season.

Although historical observer data are limited due to low sampling effort, bycatch of female and sublegal male crab from
the directed blue king crab fishery off St. Matthew Island was relatively high historically, with estimated total
bycatch in terms of number of crab captured sometimes more than twice as high as the catch of legal crab (Moore et al.
2000; ADF&G Crab Observer Database). Pot-lift sampling by ADF&G crab observers (Gaeuman 2013; ADF&G Crab Observer
Database) indicates similar bycatch rates of discarded male crab since the reopening of the fishery (Table
\@ref(tab:stage-cpue-1)), with total male discard mortality in the 2012/13 directed fishery estimated at about 12% (88
t or 0.193 million pounds) of the reported retained catch weight, assuming 20% handling mortality.

These data suggest a reduction in the bycatch of females, which may be attributable to the later timing of the
contemporary fishery and the more offshore distribution of fishery effort since reopening in 2009/10^[D. Pengilly,
ADF&G, pers. comm.]. Some bycatch of discarded blue king crab has also been observed historically in the eastern Bering
Sea snow crab fishery, but in recent years it has generally been negligible.  The St. Matthew Island golden king crab
fishery, the third commercial crab fishery to have taken place in the area,  typically occurred in areas with depths
exceeding blue king crab distribution. The NMFS observer data suggest that variable, but mostly limited, SMBKC bycatch has
also occurred in the eastern Bering Sea groundfish fisheries (Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-groundfish-bycatch)).

# D. Data {-}

## Summary of New Information {-}

Data used in this assessment were updated to include the most recently available fishery and survey numbers. This
assessment uses one new survey data point, which is the 2019 NMFS trawl-survey estimate of abudance, and
its associated size compositon data. 
The assessment also uses updated 1993-2018 groundfish and fixed gear bycatch estimates based on AKRO data.
The fishery was closed in 2018/19 so no directed fishery catch data were available. 
The data used in each of the new models is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:data-extent).

## Major Data Sources {-}

Major data sources used in this assessment include annual directed-fishery retained-catch statistics from fish tickets
(1978/79-1998/99, 2009/10-2012/13, and 2014/15-2015/16; Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-fishery)); results from the annual NMFS
eastern Bering Sea trawl survey (1978-2019; Table \@ref(tab:stage-cpue-nmfs)); results from the ADF&G SMBKC pot
survey (every third year during 1995-2013, then 2015-2018; Table \@ref(tab:stage-cpue));
mean somatic mass given length category by year (Table \@ref(tab:length-weight)); 
size-frequency information from ADF&G crab-observer pot-lift sampling (1990/91-1998/99, 2009/10-2012/13, and
2014/15-2016/17; Table \@ref(tab:stage-cpue-1)); and the NMFS groundfish-observer bycatch biomass estimates (1992/93-2018/19;
Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-groundfish-bycatch)).

Figure \@ref(fig:stations) maps stations from which SMBKC trawl-survey and pot-survey data were obtained. 
Further information concerning the NMFS trawl survey as it relates to commercial crab species is available in Daly et al.
(2014); see Gish et al. (2012) for a description of ADF&G SMBKC pot-survey methods. 
It should be noted that the two surveys cover different geographic regions and that each has in some years encountered proportionally large numbers of male blue king crab in areas not covered by the other survey (Figure \@ref(fig:catch181)). 
Crab-observer sampling protocols are detailed in the crab-observer training manual (ADF&G 2013). 
Groundfish SMBKC bycatch data come from the NMFS Regional office and have been compiled to coincide with the 
SMBKC management area.


## Other Data Sources {-}

The growth transition matrix used is based on Otto and Cummiskey (1990), as in the past. Other relevant data sources,
including assumed population and fishery parameters, are presented in Appendix A, which also provides a detailed
description of the model configuration used for this assessment.

# E. Analytic Approach {-}

## History of Modeling Approaches for this Stock {-}

A four-stage catch-survey-analysis (CSA) assessment model was used before 2011 to estimate abundance and biomass and
prescribe fishery quotas for the SMBKC stock. The four-stage CSA is similar to a full
length-based analysis, the major difference being coarser length groups, which are more suited to a small stock with
consistently low survey catches. In this approach, the abundance of male crab with a CL $\ge$ 90 mm is modeled in
terms of four crab stages: stage 1: 90-104 mm CL; stage 2: 105-119 mm CL; stage 3: newshell 120-133 mm CL; and stage 4:
oldshell $\ge$ 120 mm CL and newshell $\ge$ 134 mm CL. Motivation for these stage definitions comes from the fact that
for management of the SMBKC stock, male crab measuring $\ge$ 105 mm CL are considered mature, whereas 120 mm CL is
considered a proxy for the legal size of 5.5 in carapace width, including spines. Additional motivation for these stage
definitions comes from an estimated average growth increment of about 14 mm per molt for SMBKC (Otto and Cummiskey
1990).

Concerns about the pre-2011 assessment model led to the CPT and SSC recommendations that included development of an
alternative model with provisional assessment based on survey biomass or some other index of abundance. An alternative
3-stage model was proposed to the CPT in May 2011, but a survey-based approach was requested for the Fall
2011 assessment. In May 2012 the CPT approved a slightly revised and better documented version of the alternative model
for assessment. Subsequently, the model developed and used since  2012 was a variant of the previous four-stage SMBKC
CSA model and similar in complexity to that described by Collie et al. (2005). Like the earlier model, it considered
only male crab $\ge$ 90 mm in CL, but combined stages 3 and 4 of the earlier model, resulting in three stages
(male size classes) defined by CL measurements of (1) 90-104 mm, (2) 105-119 mm, and (3) 120 mm+ (i.e., 120 mm and
above). This consolidation was driven by concern about the accuracy and consistency of shell-condition information,
which had been used in distinguishing stages 3 and 4 of the earlier model.

In 2016 the accepted SMBKC assessment model made use of the modeling framework Gmacs (Webber et al. 2016). In that
assessment,  an effort was made to match the 2015 SMBKC stock assessment model to bridge a framework which 
provided greater flexibility and opportunity to evaluate model assumptions more fully.

## Assessment Methodology {-}

This assessment model again uses the modeling framework Gmacs and is detailed in Appendix A.

## Model Selection and Evaluation {-}

Four models are presented with the reference model being the same configuration as approved last year (Ianelli et al. 2018), 
two sensitivities are considered, one which weights the survey data more heavily and one that adds an additional CV on the
ADF&G pot survey data. In addition to these sensitivities, we evaluated the impacts of adding new data 
to the reference model. In summary, the following lists the models presented and the naming convention used:

1. **18.0 - 2018 Model**: the 2018 recommended model without any new data

2. **19.0 - 2019 Reference Model**: new data for 2019: NMFS trawl-survey and bycatch updates for groundfish

3. **19.0a - 2019 Model - alt reference pts**: model 19.0 with alternative time frames for reference points and projections

4. **19.1 - fit survey**: an exploratory scenario that's the same as the reference model except the NMFS trawl survey is up-weighted by
   $\lambda^\text{NMFS}= 1.5$  and the ADF&G pot survey is up-weighted by $\lambda^\text{ADFG}= 2$ . 

5. **19.2 - add CV pot**: includes an estimated additional CV on the ADF&G pot survey

Note that SSC convention would label these (item 2 above) as model 16.0 (the model first developed in that year). Since only a few models are presented here, for simplicity we labeled model 16.0 as "reference" and for the others, we used the simple naming convention
presented above.

## Results {-}

### a. Sensitivity to new data {-}
Results for scenarios are provided with comparisons to the 2018 model and sensitivity to new 2019 data are shown in 
Figures \@ref(fig:surv1) and \@ref(fig:surv2) with recruitment and spawning biomass shown in 
Figures \@ref(fig:rec1) and \@ref(fig:ssb1), respectively. 
The fits to survey CPUEs and spawning biomass show that the addition of new data results in a slight increase compared
to the 2018 assessment. However, neither last years or this years reference model capture the recent survey declines in
the ADF&G pot survey, or fit post 2005 trawl survey data points well. 

### b. Effective sample sizes and weighting factors {-}
Observed and estimated effective sample sizes are compared in Table \@ref(tab:effn). 
Data weighting factors, standard deviation of normalized residuals (SDNRs), and median absolute residual (MAR) are 
presented in Table \@ref(tab:data-weighting). The SDNR for the trawl survey
is acceptable at 1.66 in the reference model. Francis (2011) weighting was applied in 2017
but given the relatively few size
bins in this assessment, this application was suspended this year.  
The SDNRs for the pot surveys show a similar pattern in each of the
scenarios, but are much higher suggesting an inconsistency between 
the pot survey data and the model structure and other data
components. Rather than re-weighting, we chose to retain the values 
as specified, noting that down-weighting these data would effectively 
exclude the signal from this series. 
The MAR values for the trawl and pot surveys shows the same pattern among each of the
scenarios as the SDNR. The MAR values for the trawl survey and pot survey size compositions were relatively good,
ranging from 0.60 to 0.65 for the reference case.
The SDNRs for the directed pot fishery and other size compositions were  similar to previous estimates.

### c. Parameter estimates {-}
Model parameter estimates for each of the Gmacs scenarios are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:est-pars-ref),
\@ref(tab:est-pars-3), and \@ref(tab:est-pars-4). These parameter
estimates are compared in Table \@ref(tab:est-pars-all). Negative log-likelihood values and management measures for each
of the model configurations are compared in Tables \@ref(tab:management-quants) through \@ref(tab:likelihood-components).

There are some differences in parameter estimates among models as 
reflected in the log-likelihood components and the management quantities. 
The parameter estimates in the "fit survey" and "add CV pot" scenarios differ the most, as expected, 
particularly the estimate of the ADF&G pot survey catchability ($q$) (see Table \@ref(tab:est-pars-all)). 
Also, the residuals for recruitment in the first size group are large for these
model runs, presumably because higher estimates of recruits in some years are required by the model 
to match the observed biomass trends. 

Selectivity estimates show some variability between models (Figure \@ref(fig:selectivity)). Estimated recruitment is
variable over time for all models and in recent years is well below average (Figure \@ref(fig:recruitment)).  Estimated
mature male biomass on 15 February also fluctuates considerably (Figure \@ref(fig:mmb)). Estimated natural mortality each
year ($M_t$) is presented in Figure \@ref(fig:M-t).

Estimates of fishing morality, from the reference model, are shown to assist with the rebuilding and reference point time frame discussions (Figure \@ref(fig:fishing-mort)). Fishing mortality can not be ruled out as being an influential factor in the current stock status.

### d. Evaluation of the fit to the data.{-}
The model fits to total male ($\ge$ 90 mm CL) trawl survey biomass tend to miss the recent peak around 2010, and fits recent survey data points on the lower end of their error bars (Figures \@ref(fig:trawl-survey-biomass)). These fits are most likely being pulled down by the recent decline in the ADF&G pot survey data points, since the **add CV pot** model captures the upward error bars for these data points when it is allowed to fit the ADF&G pot survey data very poorly.
All of the models fit the pot survey CPUE poorly (Figure \@ref(fig:pot-survey-cpue)), with the **add CV pot** model having the worst fit due to the addition of variability (Figure \@ref(fig:pot-add-cv)). For the trawl survey the standardized residuals have similar patterns with the exception of recent years for the **add CV pot** model (19.2), generally poor fit to the last 15 years of data (Figure \@ref(fig:bts-resid-nmfs)). The standardized residuals for the ADF&G pot survey have similar patterns but are much larger for the "add CV pot" model than the others, for obvious reasons (Figure \@ref(fig:bts-resid-adfg)).

Fits to the size compositions for trawl survey, pot survey, and commercial observer data are reasonable but miss the largest
size category in some years (Figures \@ref(fig:sc-pot), \@ref(fig:sc-pot-discarded), and \@ref(fig:sc-trawl-discarded)) 
for all scenarios. Representative residual  plots of the composition data fits are generally poor (Figures \@ref(fig:sc-res-ref), \@ref(fig:sc-res-fit) and \@ref(fig:sc-res-addcv)).
The model fits to different types of retained and discarded catch values performed as expected given the assumed levels
of uncertainty on the input data (Figure  \@ref(fig:fit-to-catch)).

Unsurprisingly, the **fit surveys** model fits the 
the NMFS survey biomass and ADF&G pot survey CPUE  data better but still has a similar residual pattern
(Figures \@ref(fig:trawl-survey-biomass) and \@ref(fig:pot-survey-cpue)). 
It is worth noting that that this scenario (included for exploratory purposes) resulted in worse SDNR and MAR values for the two abundance indices.

### e. Retrospective and historical analyses {-}
This is only the third year a formal assessment model developed for this stock. As such, retrospective patterns and 
historical analyses relative to fisheries impacts are limited.

### f. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.{-}
Estimated standard deviations of parameters and selected management measures for the models are summarized in
Tables \@ref(tab:est-pars-ref), \@ref(tab:est-pars-3), and \@ref(tab:est-pars-4) 
(compiled in Table \@ref(tab:est-pars-all)). Probabilities for mature male biomass and OFL in 2019 are
presented in Section F.

### g. Comparison of alternative model scenarios.{-}
The estimates of mature male biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:mmb)), for the **fit survey** sensitivity 
differs from the other models due to a low value for pot survey catchability being estimated (which tends to scale the population estimate). Difference in the mature male biomass since 2010 in the **add CV pot** model are due to the model following the trajectory of the trawl survey and downweighting the declines in the pot survey. 
The **fit Survey** scenario upweights both the trawl and pot surveys abundance indices and represents a model run
that places greater emphasis on the abundance indices.
The **add CV pot** scenario places more emphasis on the trawl survey, essentially ignoring the pot survey results in more recent years (since 2010). 

In summary, the use of the reference model for management purposes is preferred since it provides the best fit to all 
of the data and is consistent with previous model specifications.  Research on alternative model specifications (e.g., natural mortality variability) was limited this year since the authors were focused on the time frame to estimate reference points and rebuilding projections (Appendix C). 
Consequently, the reference model appears reasonable and appropriate for ABC and OFL  determinations for this stock in
2019. Additionally, the **fit surveys** and the **add CV pot** models provide conflicting conditions of this stock depending on which survey results are more believable. These conflicting results, in addition to the stock being in a overfished state, should highlight the caution needed providing management advice.

# F. Calculation of the OFL and ABC{-}
The overfishing level (OFL) is the fishery-related mortality biomass associated with fishing mortality $F_\mathit{OFL}$. The SMBKC stock is currently managed as Tier 4, and only a Tier 4 analysis is presented here. Thus, given stock estimates or suitable proxy values of $B_\mathit{MSY}$ and $F_\mathit{MSY}$, along with two additional parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, $F_\mathit{OFL}$ is determined by the control rule
\begin{align}
    F_\mathit{OFL} &= 
    \begin{cases}
        F_\mathit{MSY}, &\text{ when } B/B_\mathit{MSY} > 1\\
        F_\mathit{MSY} \frac{\left( B/B_\mathit{MSY} - \alpha \right)}{(1 - \alpha)}, &\text{ when } \beta < B/B_\mathit{MSY} \le 1
    \end{cases}\\
    F_\mathit{OFL} &< F_\mathit{MSY} \text{ with directed fishery } F = 0 \text{ when } B/B_\mathit{MSY} \le \beta \notag
\end{align}
where $B$ is quantified as mature-male biomass (MMB) at mating with time of mating assigned a nominal date of 15
February. Note that as $B$ itself is a function of the fishing mortality $F_\mathit{OFL}$ (therefore numerical
approximation of $F_\mathit{OFL}$ is required). As implemented for this assessment, all calculations proceed according
to the model equations given in Appendix A. $F_\mathit{OFL}$ is taken to be full-selection fishing mortality in the
directed pot fishery and groundfish trawl and fixed-gear fishing mortalities set at their model geometric mean values
over years for which there are data-based estimates of bycatch-mortality biomass.

The currently recommended Tier 4 convention is to use the full assessment period, currently `r M[[rec_mod]]$spr_syr`-
`r M[[rec_mod]]$spr_nyr`, to define a $B_\mathit{MSY}$ proxy in terms of average estimated MMB and to set $\gamma$ = 1.0 with
assumed stock natural mortality $M$ = 0.18 $\text{yr}^{-1}$ in setting the $F_\mathit{MSY}$ proxy value $\gamma M$. The
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are assigned their default values $\alpha$ = 0.10 and $\beta$ = 0.25. The
$F_\mathit{OFL}$, OFL, ABC, and MMB in 2019 for all scenarios are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:management-quants). The ABC
is 80% of the OFL.

# G. Rebuilding Analysis {-}

This stock was declared overfished in fall of 2018 and a rebuilding plan is being constructed concurrent to the 2019 stock assessment (Appendix C). Model scenarios presented here all suggest the stock is still overfished.


# H. Data Gaps and Research Priorities {-}

The following topics have been listed as areas where more research on SMBKC is needed:

  1. Growth increments and molting probabilities as a function of size.

  2. Trawl survey catchability and selectivities.

  3. Temporal changes in spatial distributions near the island.

  4. Natural mortality.

# I. Projections and outlook {-}
The outlook for recruitment is pessimistic and the abundance relative to the proxy $B_\mathit{MSY}$ is low. 
The NMFS survey results in 2018 noted ocean conditions warmer than 
normal with an absence of a "cold pool" in the region. This could have detrimental effects on the SMBKC stocks and
should be carefully monitored. Relative to the impact of historical fishing, we again conducted a
 "dynamic-$B_0$" analysis. This procedure simply projects
the population based on estimated recruitment but removes the effect of fishing. For the reference case,
this suggests that the impact of fishing has reduced the stock to about `r .get_dynB0_df(Mbase) %>% transmute(round(100*ssb,0)) %>% slice(n())`% of what it would have been in the absence of fishing (Figure \@ref(fig:dynamic-bzero)). 
The other non-fishing contributors to the observed depleted stock trend (ignoring stock-recruit relationship) may reflect variable  survival rates due to environmental conditions and also range shifts.

# Appendix A: SMBKC Model Description {-}

## 1. Introduction {-}
The Gmacs model has been specified to account only for male crab $\ge$ 90 mm in carapace length (CL). These are
partitioned into three stages (size- classes) determined by CL measurements of (1) 90-104 mm, (2) 105-119 mm, and (3)
120+ mm. For management of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab (SMBKC) fishery, 120 mm CL is used as the proxy value
for the legal measurement of 5.5 inch carapace width (CW), whereas 105 mm CL is the management proxy for mature-male
size (state regulation *5 AAC 34.917 (d)*). 
Accordingly, within the model only stage-3 crab are retained in the directed fishery, and stage-2 and stage-3 crab together comprise the collection of mature males. Some justification for the 105 mm value is presented in Pengilly and Schmidt (1995), who used it in developing the current regulatory SMBKC harvest strategy. The term "recruit" here designates recruits to the model, i.e., annual new stage-1 crab, rather than recruits to the fishery. 
The following description of model structure reflects the Gmacs base model configuration.

## 2. Model Population Dynamics {-}

Within the model, the beginning of the crab year is assumed contemporaneous with the NMFS trawl survey, nominally assigned a date of 1 July. Although the timing of the fishery is different each year, MMB is estimated at 15 February,
which is the reference date for calculation of federal management biomass quantities. To accommodate this, each model year is split into `r M[[ref_mod]]$nseason` seasons ($t$) and a proportion of the natural mortality
($\tau_t$), scaled relative to the portions of the year, 
is applied in each of these seasons where $\sum_{t=1}^{t=5} \tau_t = 1$. 
Each model year consists of the following processes with time-breaks denoted here by "Seasons." 
However, it is important to note that actual seasons are survey-to-fishery, fishery-to Feb 15, and Feb 15 to July 1.
The following breakdown accounts for events and fishing mortality treatments:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Season 1 (survey period)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beginning of the SMBKC fishing year (1 July)
        \item $\tau_1 = 0$
        \item Surveys
    \end{itemize}
    \item Season 2 (natural mortality until pulse fishery)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tau_2$ ranges from 0.05 to 0.44 depending on the time of year the fishery begins each year (i.e., a higher value indicates the fishery begins later in the year; see Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-fishery))
    \end{itemize}
    \item Season 3 (pulse fishery)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tau_3 = 0$
        \item fishing mortality applied
    \end{itemize}
    \item Season 4 (natural mortality until spawning)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tau_4 = 0.63 - \sum_{i=1}^{i=4} \tau_i$
        \item Calculate MMB (15 February)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Season 5 (natural mortality and somatic growth through to June 30th)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tau_5 = 0.37$
        \item Growth and molting
        \item Recruitment (all to stage-1)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
The proportion of natural mortality ($\tau_t$) applied during each season in the model is provided in Table \@ref(tab:m-prop). The beginning of the year (1 July) to the date that MMB is measured (15 February) is 63% of the year. Therefore 63% of the natural mortality must be applied before the MMB is calculated. Because the timing of the fishery is different each year, $\tau_2$ varies and thus $\tau_4$ varies also.

```{r m-prop, results = "asis"}
A <- M[[2]]
df <- data.frame(A$mod_yrs, A$m_prop)
names(df) <- c("Year","Season 1","Season 2","Season 3","Season 4","Season 5")
tab <- xtable(df, digits = c(0,0,2,2,2,2,2), caption = "Proportion of the natural mortality ($\\tau_t$) that is applied during each season ($t$) in the model.", label = "tab:m-prop")
print(tab, caption.placement = "top", include.rownames = FALSE, sanitize.text.function=function(x){x})
```

With boldface lower-case letters indicating vector quantities we designate the vector of stage abundances during season $t$ and year $y$ as
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{n}_{t,y} = n_{l,t,y} = \left[ n_{1,t,y}, n_{2,t,y}, n_{3,t,y} \right]^\top.
\end{equation}
The number of new crab, or recruits, of each stage entering the model each season $t$ and year $y$ is represented as the vector $\boldsymbol{r}_{t,y}$. The SMBKC formulation of Gmacs specifies recruitment to stage-1 only during season $t=5$, thus the recruitment size distribution is
\begin{equation}
    \phi_l = \left[ 1, 0, 0 \right]^\top,
\end{equation}
and the recruitment is
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{r}_{t,y} = 
  \begin{cases}
    0 &\text{for} \quad t<5\\
    \bar{R} \phi_l \delta^R_y &\text{for} \quad t=5.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{R}$ is the average annual recruitment and $\delta^R_y$ are the recruitment deviations each year $y$
\begin{equation}
    \delta^R_y \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma_R^2 \right).
\end{equation}
Using boldface upper-case letters to indicate a matrix, we describe the size transition matrix $\boldsymbol{G}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{G} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
    1 - \pi_{12} - \pi_{13} & \pi_{12} & \pi_{13} \\
    0 & 1 - \pi_{23} & \pi_{23} \\
    0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right],
\end{equation}
with $\pi_{jk}$ equal to the proportion of stage-$j$ crab that molt and grow into stage-$k$ within a season or year. 

The natural mortality each season $t$ and year $y$ is
\begin{equation}
    M_{t,y} = \bar{M} \tau_t + \delta_y^M \text{ where } \delta_y^M \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma_M^2 \right)
\end{equation}
Fishing mortality by year $y$ and season $t$ is denoted $F_{t,y}$ and calculated as
\begin{equation}
    F_{t,y} = F_{t,y}^\text{df} + F_{t,y}^\text{tb} + F_{t,y}^\text{fb}
\end{equation}
where $F_{t,y}^\text{df}$ is the fishing mortality associated with the directed fishery, $F_{t,y}^\text{tb}$ is the fishing mortality associated with the trawl bycatch fishery, $F_{t,y}^\text{fb}$ is the fishing mortality associated with the fixed bycatch fishery. Each of these are derived as
\begin{align}
    F_{t,y}^\text{df} &= \bar{F}^\text{df} + \delta^\text{df}_{t,y} \quad \text{where} \quad \delta^\text{df}_{t,y} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_\text{df} \right), \notag\\
    F_{t,y}^\text{tb} &= \bar{F}^\text{tb} + \delta^\text{tb}_{t,y} \quad \text{where} \quad \delta^\text{df}_{t,y} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_\text{tb} \right), \notag\\
    F_{t,y}^\text{fb} &= \bar{F}^\text{fb} + \delta^\text{fb}_{t,y} \quad \text{where} \quad \delta^\text{df}_{t,y} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_\text{fb} \right),
\end{align}
where $\delta^\text{df}_{t,y}$, $\delta^\text{tb}_{t,y}$, and $\delta^\text{fb}_{t,y}$ are the fishing mortality deviations for each of the fisheries, each season $t$ during each year $y$, $\bar{F}^\text{df}$, $\bar{F}^\text{tb}$, and $\bar{F}^\text{fb}$ are the average fishing mortalities for each fishery. The total mortality $Z_{l,t,y}$ represents the combination of natural mortality $M_{t,y}$ and fishing mortality $F_{t,y}$ during season $t$ and year $y$
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{Z}_{t,y} = Z_{l,t,y} = M_{t,y} + F_{t,y}.
\end{equation}
The survival matrix $\boldsymbol{S}_{t,y}$ during season $t$ and year $y$ is
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{S}_{t,y} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
    1-e^{-Z_{1,t,y}} & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1-e^{-Z_{2,t,y}} & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1-e^{-Z_{3,t,y}} \end{array} \right].
\end{equation}

The basic population dynamics underlying Gmacs can thus be described as
\begin{align}
    \boldsymbol{n}_{t+1,y} &= \boldsymbol{S}_{t,y} \boldsymbol{n}_{t,y}, &\text{ if } t<5 \notag\\
    \boldsymbol{n}_{t,y+1} &= \boldsymbol{G} \boldsymbol{S}_{t,y} \boldsymbol{n}_{t,y} + \boldsymbol{r}_{t,y} &\text{ if } t=5.
\end{align}

## 5. Model Objective Function and Weighting Scheme {-}

The objective function consists of the sum of several "negative log-likelihood" terms characterizing the hypothesized error structure of the principal data inputs (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components)). A lognormal distribution is assumed to characterize the catch data and is modelled as
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{t,y}^\text{catch} &= \sqrt{\log \left( 1 + \left( \mathit{CV}_{t,y}^\text{catch} \right)^2 \right)}\\
  \delta_{t,y}^\text{catch} &= \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \left( \sigma_{t,y}^\text{catch} \right)^2 \right)
\end{align}
where $\delta_{t,y}^\text{catch}$ is the residual catch. The relative abudance data is also assumed to be lognormally distributed
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{t,y}^\text{I} &= \frac{1}{\lambda} \sqrt{\log \left( 1 + \left( \mathit{CV}_{t,y}^\text{I} \right)^2 \right)}\\
  \delta_{t,y}^\text{I} &= \log \left( I^\text{obs} / I^\text{pred} \right) / \sigma_{t,y}^\text{I} + 0.5 \sigma_{t,y}^\text{I}
\end{align}
and the likelihood is
\begin{equation}
  \sum \log \left( \delta_{t,y}^\text{I} \right) + \sum 0.5 \left( \sigma_{t,y}^\text{I} \right)^2
\end{equation}


Gmacs calculates standard deviation of the normalised residual (SDNR) values
and median of the absolute residual (MAR) values for all abundance indices and
size compositions to help the user come up with resonable likelihood weights.
For an abundance data set to be well fitted, the SDNR should not be much
greater than 1 (a value much less than 1, which means that the data set is
fitted better than was expected, is not a cause for concern). What is meant by
"much greater than 1" depends on $m$ (the number of years in the data set).
Francis (2011) suggests upper limits of 1.54, 1.37, and 1.26 for $m$ = 5, 10,
and 20, respectively. Although an SDNR not much greater than 1 is a necessary
condition for a good fit, it is not sufficient. It is important to plot the
observed and expected abundances to ensure that the fit is good.

Gmacs also calculates Francis weights for each of the size composition data
sets supplied (Francis 2011). If the user wishes to use the Francis iterative
re-weighting method, first the weights applied to the abundance indices should
be adjusted by trial and error until the SDNR (and/or MAR) are adequte. Then
the Francis weights supplied by Gmacs should be used as the new likelihood
weights for each of the size composition data sets the next time the model is
run. The user can then iteratively adjust the abudance index and size
composition weights until adequate SDNR (and/or MAR) values are achieved,
given the Francis weights.

## 6. Estimation {-}

The model was implemented using the software AD Model Builder (Fournier et al.
2012), with parameter estimation by minimization of the model objective
function using automatic differentiation. Parameter estimates and standard
deviations provided in this document are AD Model Builder reported values
assuming maximum likelihood theory asymptotics.
