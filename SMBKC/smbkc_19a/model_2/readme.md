Model 2  - attempts to estimate Q for both surveys.

a) Initial attemps - similar results - ssb and recruitment to base model.
estimates of Q for trawl survey are above 1 

b) Normal prior - mean 1 and small CV (0.05). Closer the the base model estimates. 
Both this and a) estimate the trawl survey Q first (Phase 3)

c) estimate Q is the same phase (so b with same phase - 3) results: same as b) 
d) similar to Q but all in phase 2. results: no difference with phasing. same as b)

e) b) but with smaller SD for normal distribution. phases are 3 and 4 instead of 2 and 3
