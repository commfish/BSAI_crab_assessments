Model 2  - attempts to estimate Q for both surveys.

a) Initial attemps - similar results - ssb and recruitment to base model.
estimates of Q for trawl survey are above 1 

b) Normal prior - mean 1 and small CV (0.05). Closer the the base model estimates. 
Both this and a) estimate the trawl survey Q first (Phase 3)
