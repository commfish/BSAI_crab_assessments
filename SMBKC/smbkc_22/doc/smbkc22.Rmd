# Executive Summary {-}
1. **Stock**: Blue king crab, *Paralithodes platypus*, Saint Matthew Island (SMBKC), Alaska.

2. **Catches**: Peak historical harvest was 4,288 t (9.454 million pounds) in 1983/84^[1983/84 refers to a fishing
year that extends from 1 July 1983 to 30 June 1984.]. 
The fishery was closed for 10 years after the stock was declared overfished in 1999. 
Fishing resumed in 2009/10 with a fishery-reported retained catch of 209 t (0.461 million
pounds), less than half the 529.3 t (1.167 million pound) TAC.
Following three more years of modest harvests
supported by a fishery catch per unit effort (CPUE) of around 10 crab per pot lift, the fishery was again closed in
2013/14 due to declining trawl-survey estimates of abundance and concerns about the health of the stock. 
The directed fishery resumed again in 2014/15 with a TAC of 300 t (0.655 million pounds), but the fishery performance was
relatively poor with a retained catch of 140 t (0.309 million pounds). 
The retained catch in 2015/16 was even lower at 48 t (0.105 million pounds) and the fishery has remained closed since 2016/17.

3. **Stock biomass**:  The 1978-2021 NMFS trawl survey mean biomass is 5,605 t with the 2021 value being the
9th lowest (1,929 t; the seventh lowest since 2000). 
This 2021 biomass of $\ge$ 90 mm carapace length (CL) male crab is 
35% of the long term mean  at 4.25 million pounds (with a CV of 43%), and an 39% decrease from the 2019 biomass (due to the cancellation of the 2020 survey estimates
are compared to 2019 as the last survey year).
The most recent 3-year average of the NMFS survey is 41% of the mean value, indicating a decline in biomass compared to
historical survey estimates, notably in 2010 and 2011 that were over four times the current average.
Additionally, the 2021 value decreased from the 2019 value, falling closer to the two previous years (1,929 t compared to 1,731 t in 2018 and 1,794 t in 2017).

The ADFG pot survey last occurred in 2018, when the relative biomass index was the lowest
in the time series (12% of the mean from the 11 surveys conducted since 1995).
The assessment model estimates temper this increase and suggest that the stock (in survey biomass units) is presently at about
`r bio_lt_percent `% 
of the long term model-predicted survey biomass average, similar to the last three years. 
The trend from these values suggests a steady state in the last few years, which does not fit the 2019 observed survey data point well.

4. **Recruitment**: Recruitment is based on estimated number of male crab within the 90-104 mm CL size class
in each year. The 2021 trawl-survey area-swept estimate of 0.423 million male SMBKC in this size class is the 15th lowest in 
the 43 years since 1978 and follows two of the lowest previously observed values in 2017 and 2018. 
The recent six-year (2015 - 2021) average recruitment is only 43% of the long-term mean. 
In the pot-survey, the abundance of this size group in 2017 was also the second-lowest in the time series (22% of the mean for the 
available pot-survey data) whereas in 2018 the value was the lowest observed at only 10% of the mean value.

5. **Management performance**: In this assessment, estimated total male catch is the sum of fishery-reported retained
catch, estimated male discard mortality in the directed fishery, and estimated male bycatch mortality in the groundfish fisheries.
Based on the reference model for SMBKC, the estimate for mature male biomass was below the minimum stock-size threshold (MSST) in 2018/19 and is in an "overfished" condition, despite a directed fishery closure since the 2016/17 season 
(and hence overfishing has not occurred) (Tables \@ref(tab:status), \@ref(tab:ofl-basis), and \@ref(tab:management-quants)). 
Computations which indicate the relative impact of fishing 
(i.e., the "dynamic $B_0$") suggests, that the current spawning stock biomass has been reduced to `r .get_dynB0_df(Mbase) %>% transmute(round(100*ssb,0)) %>% slice(n())`% of what it would have been in the absence of fishing, assuming the same level of recruitment as estimated.

6. **Basis for the OFL**: Estimated mature-male biomass (MMB) on 15 February is used as the measure of 
 biomass for this Tier 4 stock, with males measuring $\ge$ 105 mm CL considered mature. 
 The $B_\mathit{MSY}$ proxy is obtained by averaging estimated MMB over a specific reference period, and current CPT/SSC guidance recommends using the full assessment time frame (1978 - 2019) as the default reference period.

# A. Summary of Major Changes {-}

## Changes in Management of the Fishery {-}

There are no new changes in management of the fishery.

## Changes to the Input Data {-}

Data used in this assessment have been updated to include the most recently
available fishery data. 
This assessment includes one new survey data points of the 2021 NMFS trawl-survey, which is included here since this assessment is now on a biennial cycle.  
The triennial ADF&G pot surveys were last conducted in 2018, and are back on a semi-triennial cycle, with the next survey planned for 2022.
There is new size composition data from the trawl survey. 
The assessment was updated with 2010-2020 groundfish trawl and
fixed gear bycatch estimates based on NMFS Alaska Regional Office (AKRO) data. 
The directed fishery has been closed since 2016/17, so no recent fishery data are available.

## Changes in Assessment Methodology {-}

This assessment uses the General Model for Alaska Crab Stocks (GMACS) framework. The
model is configured to track three stages of length categories and was 
first presented in May 2011 by W.Gaeuman, ADF&G, and accepted by the CPT in May 2012. 
A difference from the original approach and that used here is that natural and fishing mortalities are
continuous within `r M[[ref_mod]]$nseason` discrete time blocks within a year (using the appropriate catch equation rather than assuming an applied pulse removal). 
The time blocks within a year in GMACS are controlled by changing the proportion of natural mortality that is applied each block. 
Diagnostic output includes estimates of the "dynamic $B_0$" which simply
computes the ratio of the estimated spawning biomass relative to the spawning biomass that would have occurred 
had there been no historical fishing mortality. 
Details of this implementation and other model details are provided in Appendix A.

## Changes in Assessment Results {-}

Both surveys indicate a decline over the past few years. The "reference" model is that which was selected for use in 2020, the year of the last full assessment.
The base model presented here is the reference model with updated groundfish bycatch data for the 2020/21 crab season and updated survey data - biomass and size composition - from the 2021 NMFS trawl survey (model 16.0 2022). 

In addition to the reference/base model other models are presented here for sensitivity of life history constants. Here two models are presented that raise the natural mortality from the accepted fixed value of 0.18 for king crab. Model 22.0a has a M = 0.21 and Model 22.0b has a M = 0.26. These values were taken from methods of Hoenig (ref?) and Then et al. (ref) using a maximum age of 25 or 30 years. Assuming a maximum age of less than 25 years produced a high estimate of natural mortality using Then et al. methods.


# B. Responses to SSC and CPT  {-}

## CPT and SSC Comments on Assessments in General {-}


Comment: *Regarding general code development, the SSC and CPT outstanding requests continue to be as follows:*

  1. *Continued exploration of data weighting (Francis and other approaches) and evaluation of models with and without the 1998 natural mortality spike. The authors are encouraged to bring other models forward for CPT and SSC consideration*
  
     We continued with the iterative re-weighting for composition data (Table \@ref(tab:data-weighting)). We did not address models without the natural mortality spike. These have been considered previously. 

Comment: *Explore potential explanations for the discrepancy in the time trends of the two types of survey data, including movement hypotheses using spatial models (not necessarily VAST)*
  
  Exploration of the spatial extent and density differences between the surveys was done on all male crab included in the model (Appendix C). The authors plan to use this and further analyses to better characterize catchability/availability for the pot survey. 

Comment: *Explore VAST estimates compared to design based, and ones that combine the two surveys*

  Progress is underway to refine the SMBKC VAST estimates using preliminary code that incorporates the island effect. Jon Richar (NMFS) is working on these estimates. At the time of this final SAFE there are no additional improvements to this data set and therefore the VAST model is not presented as a model option. Future work on VAST models for this stock includes VAST data output for the NMFS trawl survey incorporating the island effect and VAST output using both survey data sets together. 

Comment:  *Random walk or exploration of catchability*
    
   The initial model of time blocks for Q did not show much potential for this in May 2020, therefore time blocks were not a focus for May 2022. More coding work is needed to make a true random walk for catchability GMACS and this will be added to GMACS model development. 
     
Comment: *Consider increasing the number of size bins so that cohorts might be more easily tracked and growth better estimated*
   A full review of the research and literature for blue king crab is underway but no changes to the assessment model size bins were considered in this review due to the lack of a concrete basis for these changes and concern over sample size reductions with increased size bins.

Comment: *Explore the assumed and estimated life history parameters (e.g., natural mortality, growth, and maturity) to ensure the best available science is being used to assess this stock.*
   Specific research on St.Matthew blue king crab life history parameters is not available and therefore these are borrowed from other stocks/species.    

# C. Introduction {-}

## Scientific Name {-}

The blue king crab is a lithodid crab, *Paralithodes platypus* (Brant 1850).

## Distribution {-}

Blue king crab are sporadically distributed throughout the North Pacific Ocean from Hokkaido, Japan, to southeastern
Alaska (Figure \@ref(fig:distribution)).  In the eastern Bering Sea small populations are distributed around St. Matthew
Island, the Pribilof Islands, St. Lawrence Island, and Nunivak Island. Isolated populations also exist in some other
cold water areas of the Gulf of Alaska (NPFMC 1998). The St. Matthew Island Section for blue king crab is within Area Q2
(Figure \@ref(fig:registration)), which is the Northern District of the Bering Sea king crab registration area and
includes the waters north of Cape Newenham (58&deg;39' N. lat.) and south of Cape Romanzof (61&deg;49' N. lat.).

## Stock Structure {-}

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) Gene Conservation Laboratory, has detected regional population
differences between blue king crab collected from St. Matthew Island and the Pribilof Islands^[NOAA grant Bering Sea
Crab Research II, NA16FN2621, 1997.]. 
The NMFS tag-return data from studies on blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands and
St. Matthew Island support the idea that legal-sized males do not migrate between the two areas (Otto and Cummiskey
1990). St. Matthew Island blue king crab tend to be smaller than their Pribilof conspecifics, and the two stocks are
managed separately.

## Life History {-}

Like the red king crab, *Paralithodes camtshaticus*, the blue king crab is considered a shallow water species by
comparison with other lithodids such as golden king crab, *Lithodes aequispinus*, and the scarlet king crab, 
*Lithodes couesi* (Donaldson and Byersdorfer 2005). Adult male blue king crab are found at an average depth of 70 m (NPFMC 1998).
The reproductive cycle appears to be annual for the first two reproductive cycles and biennial thereafter (Jensen
and Armstrong 1989), and mature crab seasonally migrate inshore where they molt and mate. Unlike red king crab, juvenile
blue king crab do not form pods, but instead rely on cryptic coloration for protection from predators and require
suitable habitat such as cobble and shell hash. Somerton and MacIntosh (1983) estimated SMBKC male size at sexual
maturity to be 77 mm carapace length (CL). Paul et al. (1991) found that spermatophores were present in the vas deferens
of 50% of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab males examined with sizes of 40-49 mm CL and in 100% of the males at
least 100 mm CL. Spermataphore diameter also increased with increasing CL with an asymptote at ~ 100 mm CL. It was noted,
however, that although spermataphore presence indicates physiological sexual maturity, it may not be an indicator of
functional sexual maturity. For purposes of management of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab fishery, the State of
Alaska uses 105 mm CL to define the lower size bound of functionally mature males (Pengilly and Schmidt 1995). Otto and
Cummiskey (1990) report an average growth increment of 14.1 mm CL for adult SMBKC males.

## Management History {-}

The SMBKC fishery developed subsequent to baseline ecological studies associated with oil exploration (Otto 1990). Ten
U.S. vessels harvested 545 t (1.202 million pounds) in 1977, and harvests peaked in 1983 when 164 vessels landed 4,288 t
(9.454 million pounds) (Fitch et al. 2012; Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-fishery)).

The fishing seasons were generally short, often lasting only a few days. The fishery was declared overfished and closed
in 1999 when the stock biomass estimate was below the minimum stock-size threshold (MSST) of 4,990 t (11.0 million
pounds) as defined by the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands King and Tanner crabs (NPFMC
1999). Zheng and Kruse (2002) hypothesized a high level of SMBKC natural mortality from 1998 to 1999 as an explanation
for the low catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the 1998/99 commercial fishery and the low numbers across all male crab size
groups caught in the annual NMFS eastern Bering Sea trawl survey from 1999 to 2005 (see survey data in next section). In
November 2000, Amendment 15 to the FMP for Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands king and Tanner crabs was approved to implement a
rebuilding plan for the SMBKC stock (NPFMC 2000). The rebuilding plan included a State of Alaska regulatory harvest strategy 
(*5 AAC 34.917*), area closures, and gear modifications. In addition, commercial crab fisheries near St. Matthew Island were
scheduled in fall and early winter to reduce the potential for bycatch mortality of vulnerable molting and mating crab.

NMFS declared the stock rebuilt on 21 September 2009, and the fishery was reopened after a 10-year closure on 15 October
2009 with a TAC of 529 t (1.167 million pounds), closing again by regulation on 1 February 2010. Seven participating
vessels landed a catch of 209 t (0.461 million pounds) with a reported effort of 10,697 pot lifts and an estimated CPUE of
9.9 retained individual crab per pot lift. The fishery remained open the next three years with modest harvests and
similar CPUE, but large declines in the NMFS trawl-survey estimate of stock abundance raised concerns about the health
of the stock. This prompted ADF&G to close the fishery again for the 2013/14 season. 
The fishery was reopened for the 2014/15 season with a low TAC of 297 t (0.655 million pounds) and in 2015/16 the TAC
was further reduced to 186 t (0.411 million pounds) then completely closed the 2016/17 season.

Although historical observer data are limited due to low sampling effort, bycatch of female and sublegal male crab from
the directed blue king crab fishery off St. Matthew Island was relatively high historically, with estimated total
bycatch in terms of number of crab captured sometimes more than twice as high as the catch of legal crab (Moore et al.
2000; ADF&G Crab Observer Database). Pot-lift sampling by ADF&G crab observers (Gaeuman 2013; ADF&G Crab Observer
Database) indicates similar bycatch rates of discarded male crab since the reopening of the fishery (Table
\@ref(tab:stage-cpue-1)), with total male discard mortality in the 2012/13 directed fishery estimated at about 12% (88
t or 0.193 million pounds) of the reported retained catch weight, assuming 20% handling mortality.

These data suggest a reduction in the bycatch of females, which may be attributable to the later timing of the
contemporary fishery and the more offshore distribution of fishery effort since reopening in 2009/10^[D. Pengilly,
ADF&G, pers. comm.]. Some bycatch of discarded blue king crab has also been observed historically in the eastern Bering
Sea snow crab fishery, but in recent years it has generally been negligible.  The St. Matthew Island golden king crab
fishery, the third commercial crab fishery to have taken place in the area,  typically occurred in areas with depths
exceeding blue king crab distribution. The NMFS observer data suggest that variable, but mostly limited, SMBKC bycatch has
also occurred in the eastern Bering Sea groundfish fisheries (Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-groundfish-bycatch)).

# D. Data {-}

## Summary of New Information {-}

Data used in this assessment were updated to include the most recently available fishery and survey estimates. 
The only new data in the 2020 assessment model is updated bycatch estimates, no new survey or size composition data were added.
The assessment uses updated 1993-2019 groundfish and fixed gear bycatch estimates based on NMFS AKRO data.
The directed fishery has been closed since the 2016/17 season, and therefore no directed fishery catch data are available. 
The data used in each of the new models is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:data-extent).

## Major Data Sources {-}

Major data sources used in this assessment include annual directed-fishery retained-catch statistics from fish tickets
(1978/79-1998/99, 2009/10-2012/13, and 2014/15-2015/16; Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-fishery)); results from the annual NMFS
eastern Bering Sea trawl survey (1978-2019; Table \@ref(tab:stage-cpue-nmfs)); results from the ADF&G SMBKC pot
survey (every third year during 1995-2013, then 2015-2018; Table \@ref(tab:stage-cpue));
mean somatic mass given length category by year (Table \@ref(tab:length-weight)); 
size-frequency information from ADF&G crab-observer pot-lift sampling (1990/91-1998/99, 2009/10-2012/13, and
2014/15-2016/17; Table \@ref(tab:stage-cpue-1)); and the NMFS groundfish-observer bycatch biomass estimates (1992/93-2019/20;
Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-groundfish-bycatch)).

Figure \@ref(fig:stations) maps stations from which SMBKC trawl-survey and pot-survey data were obtained. 
Further information concerning the NMFS trawl survey as it relates to commercial crab species is available in Daly et al.
(2014); see Gish et al. (2012) for a description of ADF&G SMBKC pot-survey methods. 
It should be noted that the two surveys cover different geographic regions and that each has in some years encountered proportionally large numbers of male blue king crab in areas not covered by the other survey (Figure \@ref(fig:catch181)). 
Crab-observer sampling protocols are detailed in the crab-observer training manual (ADF&G 2013). 
Groundfish SMBKC bycatch data come from the NMFS Regional office and have been compiled to coincide with the 
SMBKC management area.


## Other Data Sources {-}

The growth transition matrix used is based on Otto and Cummiskey (1990), as in the past. Other relevant data sources,
including assumed population and fishery parameters, are presented in Appendix A, which also provides a detailed
description of the model configuration used for this assessment.

# E. Analytic Approach {-}

## History of Modeling Approaches for this Stock {-}

A four-stage catch-survey-analysis (CSA) assessment model was used before 2011 to estimate abundance and biomass and
prescribe fishery quotas for the SMBKC stock. The four-stage CSA is similar to a full
length-based analysis, the major difference being coarser length groups, which are more suited to a small stock with
consistently low survey catches. In this approach, the abundance of male crab with a CL $\ge$ 90 mm is modeled in
terms of four crab stages: stage 1: 90-104 mm CL; stage 2: 105-119 mm CL; stage 3: newshell 120-133 mm CL; and stage 4:
oldshell $\ge$ 120 mm CL and newshell $\ge$ 134 mm CL. Motivation for these stage definitions comes from the fact that
for management of the SMBKC stock, male crab measuring $\ge$ 105 mm CL are considered mature, whereas 120 mm CL is
considered a proxy for the legal size of 5.5 in carapace width, including spines. Additional motivation for these stage
definitions comes from an estimated average growth increment of about 14 mm per molt for SMBKC (Otto and Cummiskey
1990).

Concerns about the pre-2011 assessment model led to the CPT and SSC recommendations that included development of an
alternative model with provisional assessment based on survey biomass or some other index of abundance. An alternative
3-stage model was proposed to the CPT in May 2011, but a survey-based approach was requested for the Fall
2011 assessment. In May 2012 the CPT approved a slightly revised and better documented version of the alternative model
for assessment. Subsequently, the model developed and used since  2012 was a variant of the previous four-stage SMBKC
CSA model and similar in complexity to that described by Collie et al. (2005). Like the earlier model, it considered
only male crab $\ge$ 90 mm in CL, but combined stages 3 and 4 of the earlier model, resulting in three stages
(male size classes) defined by CL measurements of (1) 90-104 mm, (2) 105-119 mm, and (3) 120 mm+ (i.e., 120 mm and
above). This consolidation was driven by concern about the accuracy and consistency of shell-condition information,
which had been used in distinguishing stages 3 and 4 of the earlier model.

In 2016 the accepted SMBKC assessment model made use of the modeling framework GMACS encompassing a three-stage model structure (Webber et al. 2016). In that
assessment,  an effort was made to match the 2015 SMBKC stock assessment model to bridge a framework which 
provided greater flexibility and opportunity to evaluate model assumptions more fully.

## Assessment Methodology {-}

This assessment model again uses the modeling framework GMACS and is detailed in Appendix A.

## Model Selection and Evaluation {-}

Two models are presented with the reference model being the same configuration as approved last year (Palof et al. 2019), 
one sensitivity is considered which excludes the ADF&G pot survey data. In addition to this sensitivty, we evaluated
the impacts of adding new data (here just groundfish bycatch) to the reference model. 
In summary, the following lists the models presented and the naming convention used: 

1. **16.0 - 2019 Model**: 2019 accepted model

2. **16.0 - 2020 Base Model**: updated with 2019/20 groudfish bycatch 

3. **16.0a - 2020 Base Model with fixed terminal year recruitment**: terminal year recruitment fixed as the average of the last seven years

4. **20.1 - no ADF&G pot survey data**: model 16.0 - excludes ADF&G pot survey data - abundace and length comps

Note the change in naming convention (per SSC comments). The base model is model 16.0 since that was the year of model development and acceptance. 

## Results {-}

### a. Sensitivity to new data {-}
There is no new survey data for the September 2020 model runs, the only additional data is groundfish bycatch data for the 2019/20 crab season. Additionally, the groundfish bycatch data was updated for past years due to some changes in the weights used to estimate crab bycatch in the groundfish fisheries (per. comm. NMFS AKRO). The 2020 reference model is compared here to the 2019 accepted model, which is shown in Figures \@ref(fig:surv1) and \@ref(fig:surv2) with recruitment and spawning biomass shown in 
Figures \@ref(fig:rec1) and \@ref(fig:ssb1), respectively. 
The 2019 accepted model and the 2020 base model have identical fits to the survey data, as well as identical estimates of SSB and recruitment. This is expected since there are no new influential data in the 2020 model. 
As has been noted in the past, the reference model still does not capture the recent survey declines in
the ADF&G pot survey, or fit post 2005 trawl survey data points well. 

### b. Effective sample sizes and weighting factors {-}
Observed and estimated effective sample sizes are compared in Table \@ref(tab:effn). 
Data weighting factors, standard deviation of normalized residuals (SDNRs), and median absolute residual (MAR) are 
presented in Table \@ref(tab:data-weighting). 
Currently the SDNR and MAR are not outputting correctly for the survey data in GMACS.  This is on the list to address at the Januaury 2021 modeling workshop.
In Sept. 2019 the SDNR for the trawl survey
was acceptable at 1.66 in the base model. Francis (2011) weighting was applied in 2017 but given the relatively few size bins in this assessment, this application was suspended for this assessment.  

In Sept. 2019 the SDNRs for the pot surveys showed a similar pattern in each of the
scenarios, but are much higher suggesting an inconsistency between 
the pot survey data and the model structure and other data
components. Rather than re-weighting, we chose to retain the values 
as specified, noting that down-weighting these data would effectively 
exclude the signal from this series. 
The MAR values for the trawl and pot surveys showed the same pattern among each of the
scenarios as the SDNR. The MAR values for the trawl survey and pot survey size compositions were adequate,
ranging from 0.60 to 0.68 for the reference case.
The SDNRs for the directed pot fishery and other size compositions were similar to previous estimates.

### c. Parameter estimates {-}
Model parameter estimates for each of the GMACS scenarios are summarized in Tables \@ref(tab:est-pars-ref), \@ref(tab:est-pars-fixR), and \@ref(tab:est-pars-4). These parameter
estimates are compared in Table \@ref(tab:est-pars-all). Negative log-likelihood values and management measures for each
of the model configurations are compared in Tables \@ref(tab:management-quants) and \@ref(tab:likelihood-components).

There are differences in parameter estimates among models as 
reflected in the log-likelihood components and the management quantities. 
The parameter estimates in the "no pot" scenario differ greatly from the base model, as expected, due to the removal of recent ADF&G pot survey data points that pulled the MMB trend downward (Table \@ref(tab:est-pars-all)). 
Also, the size composition residuals are smaller for the trawl survey in the **nopot** model, presumably because 
they are allowed to fit these size compositions better due to the removal of the size composition data from the ADF&G pot survey.  

Selectivity estimates for the directed fishery show some variability between models (Figure \@ref(fig:selectivity)). 
Estimated recruitment is similar in both models until the mid-2000s when the **no pot** model (20.1) has consistently higher recruitment, contributing to higher MMB for this model in recent years (Figure \@ref(fig:recruitment)). 
Estimated mature male biomass on 15 February also is considerably higher in the **no pot** model (Figure \@ref(fig:mmb)). 
The **no pot** model has a better fit to recent years of the NMFS trawl survey data, fitting most of the post-2010 data ranges (fit line encompasses the error bars), compared to the reference model that only fits three of the last 10 years. The improved fit of the trawl survey corresponds to increased MMB estimates in the last 10 years. Not surprisingly this time frame also corresponds to sharp declines in the ADF&G pot survey abundance estimates that started in the post-2010 data. 


Estimated natural mortality in each year ($M_t$) is presented in Figure \@ref(fig:M-t), 
showing the mortality event in the late 90s.
Estimates of fishing morality, from the base model (16.0), are shown to assist with the rebuilding and reference point time frame discussions (Figure \@ref(fig:fishing-mort)). Fishing mortality can not be ruled out as being an influential factor in the current stock status.

### d. Evaluation of the fit to the data.{-}
The base model fit to total male ($\ge$ 90 mm CL) trawl survey biomass tends to miss the recent peak around 2010 and fits recent survey data points on the lower end of their error bars (Figures \@ref(fig:trawl-survey-biomass)). 
These fits are most likely being pulled down by the recent decline in the ADF&G pot survey data points, since the **no pot** model captures more of the error bars for these data points when the NMFS trawl survey data is the only abundance index in the model. 
However, this model, similar to the additional CV models presenting in May 2020, tend to overfit the recent trawl survey data points (Figure \@ref(fig:trawl-survey-biomass)).


The base model fit to the pot survey CPUE is similar to past reference models, fitting the overall trends in the data but not capturing some of the high and low points (Figure \@ref(fig:pot-survey-cpue)). 

For the trawl survey the standardized residuals are more balanced in model 20.1 (**no pot**), without the ADF&G pot survey data, especially in recent years. The base model has a clear residual pattern in the last 15 years, continually under predicting the observed data points (Figure \@ref(fig:bts-resid-nmfs)). The standardized residuals for the ADF&G pot survey have similar patterns to past reference model iterations (Figure \@ref(fig:bts-resid-adfg)).

Fits to the size compositions for trawl survey, pot survey, and commercial observer data are reasonable but miss the largest
size category in some years (Figures \@ref(fig:sc-pot), \@ref(fig:sc-pot-discarded), and \@ref(fig:sc-trawl-discarded)) 
for both scenarios. 
Representative residual plots of the composition data generally have a poor fit to the three composition data sources (Figures \@ref(fig:sc-res-ref), \@ref(fig:sc-res-fixR) and \@ref(fig:sc-res-nopot)).
The model fits to different types of retained and discarded catch values performed as expected given the assumed levels
of uncertainty on the input data (Figure \@ref(fig:fit-to-catch)).


### e. Retrospective and historical analyses {-}
This is the fourth year GMACS has been used for this stock. As such, retrospective patterns and historical analyses of GMACS assessments are limited. 
However, completion of a retrospective analysis, for the base model, was completed (Figure \@ref(fig:retrospective)) and is presented in detail in Appendix C.

### f. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.{-}
Estimated standard deviations of parameters and selected management measures for the models are summarized for each individual model in
Tables \@ref(tab:est-pars-ref), \@ref(tab:est-pars-fixR), \@ref(tab:est-pars-4), and 
compiled in Table \@ref(tab:est-pars-all). Model estimates of mature male biomass and OFL in 2020 are presented in Section F.

Uncertainty surrounding the lack of a 2020 trawl survey data point was examined using two approaches and the results are contained in Appendix C. Overall, the authors did not find much additional uncertainty for the base model due to the lack of a 2020 data point. The current trajectory of the stock (MMB and recruitment) suggests a low status (below $B_{MSY}$) that would not change even with the addition of hypothetical 2020 data point (Approach 3, Appendix C).  Appendix C goes into more detail for these analyses and a more thourough discussion of the authors recommendations. 

### g. Comparison of alternative model scenarios.{-}
The estimates of mature male biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:mmb)) for the **no pot** model differs from the base model (16.0) due to the removal of the pot survey abundance and size composition data. This abundance time series contrasts with the NMFS trawl survey and when present tends to lower the scale of the population estimate. 
This difference is greatest in the last 10 years, recognizing the contrast between these abundance time series and the influence of the ADF&G pot survey on the current population status. 

In summary, the **no pot** model scenario was provided to explore the sensitivity of this model. Currently, the base model is still the most appropriate model for settting reference points and model specifications. 
Research on alternative model specifications that may address the disparities between the trawl and pot survey data are ongoing, as is proposed spatial analyses of these data sets. 
Additionally, the overfished status of this stock lends itself to maintaining the status quo base model until an appropriate resolution is found to deal with the trawl and pot survey data fit issues.
The two base models presented here, 16.0 and 16.0a, only differ in the estimation of 2019 recruitment. 
Model 16.0a fixes the 2019 recruitment to be the average of the last seven years of the model, effectively limiting the model's ability to estimate unreasonably high recruitment in the lack of a 2020 data point. However, fixing terminal year recruitment has a minimal effect on the status of the stock, projected MMB, or the resulting OFL for 2020 (Table \@ref(tab:management-quants)). The recommended model for 2020 would be the base model (16.0) to maintain consistency for this stock during the rebuilding time frame and with the lack of a 2020 data point for the trawl survey. 

# F. Calculation of the OFL and ABC{-}
The overfishing level (OFL) is the total catch associated with the $F_\mathit{OFL}$ fishing mortality. The SMBKC stock is currently managed as Tier 4, and only a Tier 4 analysis is presented here. Thus, given stock estimates or suitable proxy values of $B_\mathit{MSY}$ and $F_\mathit{MSY}$, along with two additional parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, $F_\mathit{OFL}$ is determined by the control rule
\begin{align}
    F_\mathit{OFL} &= 
    \begin{cases}
        F_\mathit{MSY}, &\text{ when } B/B_\mathit{MSY} > 1\\
        F_\mathit{MSY} \frac{\left( B/B_\mathit{MSY} - \alpha \right)}{(1 - \alpha)}, &\text{ when } \beta < B/B_\mathit{MSY} \le 1
    \end{cases}\\
    F_\mathit{OFL} &< F_\mathit{MSY} \text{ with directed fishery } F = 0 \text{ when } B/B_\mathit{MSY} \le \beta \notag
\end{align}
where $B$ is quantified as mature-male biomass (MMB) at mating with time of mating assigned a nominal date of 15
February. Note that as $B$ itself is a function of the fishing mortality $F_\mathit{OFL}$ (therefore numerical
approximation of $F_\mathit{OFL}$ is required). As implemented for this assessment, all calculations proceed according
to the model equations given in Appendix A. $F_\mathit{OFL}$ is taken to be full-selection fishing mortality in the
directed pot fishery and groundfish trawl and fixed-gear fishing mortalities set at their geometric mean values
over years for which there are data-based estimates of bycatch-mortality biomass.

The currently recommended Tier 4 convention is to use the full assessment period, currently `r M[[rec_mod]]$spr_syr` -
`r M[[rec_mod]]$spr_nyr`, to define a $B_\mathit{MSY}$ proxy in terms of average estimated MMB and to set $\gamma$ = 1.0 with
assumed stock natural mortality $M$ = 0.18 $\text{yr}^{-1}$ in setting the $F_\mathit{MSY}$ proxy value $\gamma M$. The
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are assigned their default values $\alpha$ = 0.10 and $\beta$ = 0.25. The
$F_\mathit{OFL}$, OFL, ABC, and MMB in 2019 for all scenarios are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:management-quants). The currently recommended ABC
is 75% of the OFL (ABC buffer = 25%).

# G. Rebuilding Analysis {-}

This stock was declared overfished in fall of 2018 and a rebuilding plan went before the Council for final review in June 2020. The most updated rebuilding plan can be found on the NPFMC website for the June 2020 meeting. 


# H. Data Gaps and Research Priorities {-}

The following topics have been listed as areas where more research on SMBKC is needed:

  1. Growth increments and molting probabilities as a function of size.

  2. Trawl survey catchability and selectivities.
  
  3. Pot survey catchability and selectivities.

  4. Temporal changes in spatial distributions near the island.

  5. Natural mortality.

# I. Projections and outlook {-}
The outlook for recruitment is pessimistic and the abundance relative to the proxy $B_\mathit{MSY}$ is low. 
The NMFS survey results in 2019 noted ocean conditions warmer than 
normal with an absence of a "cold pool" in the region. This could have detrimental effects on the SMBKC stock and
should be carefully monitored. 
Relative to the impact of historical fishing, we again conducted a "dynamic-$B_0$" analysis. 
This procedure simply projects the population based on estimated recruitment but removes the effect of fishing. For the reference case,
this suggests that the impact of fishing has reduced the stock to about `r .get_dynB0_df(Mbase) %>% transmute(round(100*ssb,0)) %>% slice(n())`% of what it would have been in the absence of fishing (Figure \@ref(fig:dynamic-bzero), supporting the hypothesis that fishing pressure is not the sole contributer to the decline of this stock in recent years.
The other non-fishing contributors to the observed depleted stock trend (ignoring stock-recruit relationship) may reflect variable  survival rates due to environmental conditions and also range shifts.

# Appendix A: SMBKC Model Description {-}

## 1. Introduction {-}
The GMACS model has been specified to account only for male crab $\ge$ 90 mm in carapace length (CL). These are
partitioned into three stages (size- classes) determined by CL measurements of (1) 90-104 mm, (2) 105-119 mm, and (3)
120+ mm. For management of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab (SMBKC) fishery, 120 mm CL is used as the proxy value
for the legal measurement of 5.5 inch carapace width (CW), whereas 105 mm CL is the management proxy for mature-male
size (state regulation *5 AAC 34.917 (d)*). 
Accordingly, within the model only stage-3 crab are retained in the directed fishery, and stage-2 and stage-3 crab together comprise the collection of mature males. Some justification for the 105 mm value is presented in Pengilly and Schmidt (1995), who used it in developing the current regulatory SMBKC harvest strategy. The term "recruit" here designates recruits to the model, i.e., annual new stage-1 crab, rather than recruits to the fishery. 
The following description of model structure reflects the GMACS base model configuration.

## 2. Model Population Dynamics {-}

Within the model, the beginning of the crab year is assumed contemporaneous with the NMFS trawl survey, nominally assigned a date of 1 July. Although the timing of the fishery is different each year, MMB is estimated at 15 February,
which is the reference date for calculation of federal management biomass quantities. To accommodate this, each model year is split into `r M[[ref_mod]]$nseason` seasons ($t$) and a proportion of the natural mortality
($\tau_t$), scaled relative to the portions of the year, 
is applied in each of these seasons where $\sum_{t=1}^{t=5} \tau_t = 1$. 
Each model year consists of the following processes with time-breaks denoted here by "Seasons." 
However, it is important to note that actual seasons are survey-to-fishery, fishery-to Feb 15, and Feb 15 to July 1.
The following breakdown accounts for events and fishing mortality treatments:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Season 1 (survey period)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beginning of the SMBKC fishing year (1 July)
        \item $\tau_1 = 0$
        \item Surveys
    \end{itemize}
    \item Season 2 (natural mortality until pulse fishery)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tau_2$ ranges from 0.05 to 0.44 depending on the time of year the fishery begins each year (i.e., a higher value indicates the fishery begins later in the year; see Table \@ref(tab:smbkc-fishery))
    \end{itemize}
    \item Season 3 (pulse fishery)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tau_3 = 0$
        \item fishing mortality applied
    \end{itemize}
    \item Season 4 (natural mortality until spawning)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tau_4 = 0.63 - \sum_{i=1}^{i=4} \tau_i$
        \item Calculate MMB (15 February)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Season 5 (natural mortality and somatic growth through to June 30th)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\tau_5 = 0.37$
        \item Growth and molting
        \item Recruitment (all to stage-1)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
The proportion of natural mortality ($\tau_t$) applied during each season in the model is provided in Table \@ref(tab:m-prop). The beginning of the year (1 July) to the date that MMB is measured (15 February) is 63% of the year. Therefore 63% of the natural mortality must be applied before the MMB is calculated. Because the timing of the fishery is different each year, $\tau_2$ varies and thus $\tau_4$ varies also.

```{r m-prop, results = "asis"}
A <- M[[2]]
df <- data.frame(A$mod_yrs, A$m_prop)
names(df) <- c("Year","Season 1","Season 2","Season 3","Season 4","Season 5")
tab <- xtable(df, digits = c(0,0,2,2,2,2,2), caption = "Proportion of the natural mortality ($\\tau_t$) that is applied during each season ($t$) in the model.", label = "tab:m-prop")
print(tab, caption.placement = "top", include.rownames = FALSE, sanitize.text.function=function(x){x})
```

With boldface lower-case letters indicating vector quantities we designate the vector of stage abundances during season $t$ and year $y$ as
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{n}_{t,y} = n_{l,t,y} = \left[ n_{1,t,y}, n_{2,t,y}, n_{3,t,y} \right]^\top.
\end{equation}
The number of new crab, or recruits, of each stage entering the model each season $t$ and year $y$ is represented as the vector $\boldsymbol{r}_{t,y}$. The SMBKC formulation of GMACS specifies recruitment to stage-1 only during season $t=5$, thus the recruitment size distribution is
\begin{equation}
    \phi_l = \left[ 1, 0, 0 \right]^\top,
\end{equation}
and the recruitment is
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{r}_{t,y} = 
  \begin{cases}
    0 &\text{for} \quad t<5\\
    \bar{R} \phi_l \delta^R_y &\text{for} \quad t=5.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{R}$ is the average annual recruitment and $\delta^R_y$ are the recruitment deviations each year $y$
\begin{equation}
    \delta^R_y \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma_R^2 \right).
\end{equation}
Using boldface upper-case letters to indicate a matrix, we describe the size transition matrix $\boldsymbol{G}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{G} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
    1 - \pi_{12} - \pi_{13} & \pi_{12} & \pi_{13} \\
    0 & 1 - \pi_{23} & \pi_{23} \\
    0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right],
\end{equation}
with $\pi_{jk}$ equal to the proportion of stage-$j$ crab that molt and grow into stage-$k$ within a season or year. 

The natural mortality each season $t$ and year $y$ is
\begin{equation}
    M_{t,y} = \bar{M} \tau_t + \delta_y^M \text{ where } \delta_y^M \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma_M^2 \right)
\end{equation}
Fishing mortality by year $y$ and season $t$ is denoted $F_{t,y}$ and calculated as
\begin{equation}
    F_{t,y} = F_{t,y}^\text{df} + F_{t,y}^\text{tb} + F_{t,y}^\text{fb}
\end{equation}
where $F_{t,y}^\text{df}$ is the fishing mortality associated with the directed fishery, $F_{t,y}^\text{tb}$ is the fishing mortality associated with the trawl bycatch fishery, $F_{t,y}^\text{fb}$ is the fishing mortality associated with the fixed bycatch fishery. Each of these are derived as
\begin{align}
    F_{t,y}^\text{df} &= \bar{F}^\text{df} + \delta^\text{df}_{t,y} \quad \text{where} \quad \delta^\text{df}_{t,y} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_\text{df} \right), \notag\\
    F_{t,y}^\text{tb} &= \bar{F}^\text{tb} + \delta^\text{tb}_{t,y} \quad \text{where} \quad \delta^\text{df}_{t,y} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_\text{tb} \right), \notag\\
    F_{t,y}^\text{fb} &= \bar{F}^\text{fb} + \delta^\text{fb}_{t,y} \quad \text{where} \quad \delta^\text{df}_{t,y} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_\text{fb} \right),
\end{align}
where $\delta^\text{df}_{t,y}$, $\delta^\text{tb}_{t,y}$, and $\delta^\text{fb}_{t,y}$ are the fishing mortality deviations for each of the fisheries, each season $t$ during each year $y$, $\bar{F}^\text{df}$, $\bar{F}^\text{tb}$, and $\bar{F}^\text{fb}$ are the average fishing mortalities for each fishery. The total mortality $Z_{l,t,y}$ represents the combination of natural mortality $M_{t,y}$ and fishing mortality $F_{t,y}$ during season $t$ and year $y$
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{Z}_{t,y} = Z_{l,t,y} = M_{t,y} + F_{t,y}.
\end{equation}
The survival matrix $\boldsymbol{S}_{t,y}$ during season $t$ and year $y$ is
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{S}_{t,y} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
    1-e^{-Z_{1,t,y}} & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1-e^{-Z_{2,t,y}} & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1-e^{-Z_{3,t,y}} \end{array} \right].
\end{equation}

The basic population dynamics underlying GMACS can thus be described as
\begin{align}
    \boldsymbol{n}_{t+1,y} &= \boldsymbol{S}_{t,y} \boldsymbol{n}_{t,y}, &\text{ if } t<5 \notag\\
    \boldsymbol{n}_{t,y+1} &= \boldsymbol{G} \boldsymbol{S}_{t,y} \boldsymbol{n}_{t,y} + \boldsymbol{r}_{t,y} &\text{ if } t=5.
\end{align}

## 5. Model Objective Function and Weighting Scheme {-}

The objective function consists of the sum of several "negative log-likelihood" terms characterizing the hypothesized error structure of the principal data inputs (Table \@ref(tab:likelihood-components)). A lognormal distribution is assumed to characterize the catch data and is modelled as
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{t,y}^\text{catch} &= \sqrt{\log \left( 1 + \left( \mathit{CV}_{t,y}^\text{catch} \right)^2 \right)}\\
  \delta_{t,y}^\text{catch} &= \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \left( \sigma_{t,y}^\text{catch} \right)^2 \right)
\end{align}
where $\delta_{t,y}^\text{catch}$ is the residual catch. The relative abudance data is also assumed to be lognormally distributed
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{t,y}^\text{I} &= \frac{1}{\lambda} \sqrt{\log \left( 1 + \left( \mathit{CV}_{t,y}^\text{I} \right)^2 \right)}\\
  \delta_{t,y}^\text{I} &= \log \left( I^\text{obs} / I^\text{pred} \right) / \sigma_{t,y}^\text{I} + 0.5 \sigma_{t,y}^\text{I}
\end{align}
and the likelihood is
\begin{equation}
  \sum \log \left( \delta_{t,y}^\text{I} \right) + \sum 0.5 \left( \sigma_{t,y}^\text{I} \right)^2
\end{equation}


GMACS calculates standard deviation of the normalised residual (SDNR) values
and median of the absolute residual (MAR) values for all abundance indices and
size compositions to help the user come up with resonable likelihood weights.
For an abundance data set to be well fitted, the SDNR should not be much
greater than 1 (a value much less than 1, which means that the data set is
fitted better than was expected, is not a cause for concern). What is meant by
"much greater than 1" depends on $m$ (the number of years in the data set).
Francis (2011) suggests upper limits of 1.54, 1.37, and 1.26 for $m$ = 5, 10,
and 20, respectively. Although an SDNR not much greater than 1 is a necessary
condition for a good fit, it is not sufficient. It is important to plot the
observed and expected abundances to ensure that the fit is good.

GMACS also calculates Francis weights for each of the size composition data
sets supplied (Francis 2011). If the user wishes to use the Francis iterative
re-weighting method, first the weights applied to the abundance indices should
be adjusted by trial and error until the SDNR (and/or MAR) are adequte. Then
the Francis weights supplied by GMACS should be used as the new likelihood
weights for each of the size composition data sets the next time the model is
run. The user can then iteratively adjust the abudance index and size
composition weights until adequate SDNR (and/or MAR) values are achieved,
given the Francis weights.

## 6. Estimation {-}

The model was implemented using the software AD Model Builder (Fournier et al.
2012), with parameter estimation by minimization of the model objective
function using automatic differentiation. Parameter estimates and standard
deviations provided in this document are AD Model Builder reported values
assuming maximum likelihood theory asymptotics.
