# Introduction{-}
In 2018 the MMB for SMBKC fell below 50% of the $B_{MSY}$ proxy or the MSST, using average mature male biomass from 1978-2017. The stock was determined to be overfished (but overfishing is not occurring since the fishery has been closes the last two years) and a rebuilding plan is to be implemented within 2 years. This document summarizes the projections performed on the 2019 assessment model and their associated rebuilding probabilities for the stock using the projections module developed for GMACS (A.Punt pers Comm). 
All projections presented here are performed on the base or reference model with 2019 data, results include projections that look at a alternative regime time frame for reference point calculations.
