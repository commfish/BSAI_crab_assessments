## Alternatives

Model         | Description
------------- | -------------
model_0       | - Basecase (last year's selected model 3)      
model_1       | - Andre modifications galore...
model_4       | - Apply VAST series
model_5       | - Fit surveys (lambda up on those)

Notice the use of a single .dat file for all of the different model runs. 
The .dat file sits in assessment root, 
each model has its own directory (i.e. model_1, ..., model_4), and in each model directory is a different control file.
