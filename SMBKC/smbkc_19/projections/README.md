# St. Matthews Blue King Crab Projections - for rebuilding analysis 2019
Using 2019 models - specifically model 1- the base model


# Base model - model 1 

Stock is considered rebuilt once the Bmsy is above the proxy (NOT 2 years like originally plotted)

## Rebuilding Alternatives 
All with random recruitment draws from the time period indicated.

Projection Model    | BMSY proxy years  | recruitment years | Description
------------- 			| -------------
projection 1      	| 1978-2018			    |   1978-2018		    | Using entire time frame for both BMSY proxy and recruitment draws		    
projection 5   			| 1996-2018			    | 	1996-2018		    | Using current "regime" from breakpoint analysis for both 

(similar to projection version d in May document)
	- both have average bycatch from the last 5 years (2014-2018)
	- Use state harvest policy 

## Sensitivity to bycatch mortality

option  |	Description
--------|	--------------
aa    	| 	Groundfish bycatch max that it's every been - see Table 6 2018 SAFE document - 2007
bb	  	|	  other levels of bycatch???

-conclusions: increased bycatch to 2007 levels reduces the time to rebuilding over 10 years for both proj 1 and 5, the magnitude is greater for 5.
