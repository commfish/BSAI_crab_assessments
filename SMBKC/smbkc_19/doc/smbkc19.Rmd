# Executive Summary {-}
1. **Stock**: Blue king crab, *Paralithodes platypus*, Saint Matthew Island (SMBKC), Alaska.

2. **Catches**: Peak historical harvest was 4,288 t (9.454 million pounds) in 1983/84^[1983/84 refers to a fishing
year that extends from 1 July 1983 to 30 June 1984.]. 
The fishery was closed for 10 years after the stock was declared overfished in 1999. 
Fishing resumed in 2009/10 with a fishery-reported retained catch of 209 t (0.461 million
pounds), less than half the 529.3 t (1.167 million pound) TAC.
Following three more years of modest harvests
supported by a fishery catch per unit effort (CPUE) of around 10 crab per pot lift, the fishery was again closed in
2013/14 due to declining trawl-survey estimates of abundance and concerns about the health of the stock. 
The directed fishery resumed again in 2014/15 with a TAC of 300 t (0.655 million pounds), but the fishery performance was
relatively poor with a retained catch of 140 t (0.309 million pounds). 
The retained catch in 2015/16 was even lower at 48 t (0.105 million pounds) and the fishery has remained closed since 2016/17.

3. **Stock biomass**: The 1978-2018 NMFS trawl survey mean biomass is 5,605 t with the 2019 value being the
15th lowest (3,170 t; the tenth lowest since 2000). 
This 2019 biomass of $\ge$ 90 mm carapace length (CL) male crab is 
57% of the long term mean  at 6.99 million pounds (with a CV of 34%), and is a 83% increase from the 2018 mean biomass.
The most recent 3-year average of the NMFS survey is 40% of the mean value, indicating a decline in biomass compared to
historical survey estimates, notably in 2010 and 2011 that were over four times the current average.
However, the 2019 value is substantially larger than the two previous years (3,170 t compared to 1,731 t in 2018 and 1,794 t in 2017).
The ADFG pot survey was did not take place in 2019, but in 2018 the relative biomass in this index was the lowest
in the time series (12% of the mean from the 11 surveys conducted since 1995).
The assessment model estimates tempers this increase and suggests that the stock (in survey biomass units) is presently at about
`r bio_lt_percent `% 
of the long term model-predicted survey biomass average. 
The trend from these values suggests a substantial increase, which does not fit the observed survey data points well.

4. **Recruitment**: Recruitment is based on estimated number of male crab within the 90-104 mm CL size class
in each year. The 2019 trawl-survey area-swept estimate of 0.403 million male SMBKC in this size class is the twelfth lowest in 
the 42 years since 1978 and follows two of the lowest previously observed values in 2017 and 2018. The recent six-year (2014 - 2019) average recruitment 
is only 47% of this mean. 
In the pot-survey, the abundance of this size group in 2017 was also the second-lowest in the time series (22% of the mean for the 
available pot-survey data) whereas in 2018 the value was the lowest observed at only 10% of the mean value.

5. **Management performance**: In this assessment estimated total male catch is the sum of fishery-reported retained
catch, estimated male discard mortality in the directed fishery, and estimated male bycatch mortality in the groundfish
fisheries.
Based on the reference model for SMBKC, the estimate for mature male biomass is below the minimum stock-size 
threshold (MSST) in 2017/18 and is hence is in an "overfished" condition, despite fishery closures in the last two years 
(and hence overfishing has not occurred) (Tables ). 
Computations which indicate the relative impact of fishing 
(i.e., the "dynamic $B_0$") suggests that the current spawning stock biomass has been reduced to 60%
<!--- `r #.get_dynB0_df(Mbase) %>% transmute(round(100*ssb,0)) %>% slice(n())`%  -->
 of what it would have been in the absence of fishing, assuming the same level of recruitment as estimated.

6. **Basis for the OFL**: Estimated mature-male biomass (MMB) on 15 February is used as the measure of 
 biomass for this Tier 4 stock, with males measuring $\ge$ 105 mm CL considered mature. 
 The $B_\mathit{MSY}$ proxy is obtained by averaging estimated MMB over a specific reference period, and current CPT/SSC guidance recommends using the full assessment time frame as the default reference period. 
 Both the full time frame and the current regime are presented here for consideration for 2019/20.

# A. Summary of Major Changes {-}

## Changes in Management of the Fishery {-}

There are no new changes in management of the fishery.

## Changes to the Input Data {-}

Data used in this assessment have been updated to include the most recently
available fishery and survey numbers. This assessment makes use of one new
survey data point - the 2019 NMFS trawl-survey estimate of abudance but no ADF&G pot survey was conducted in 2019.
The NMFS trawl-surveys has associated size
compositon data. The assessment also uses updated 2010-2018 groundfish and
fixed gear bycatch estimates based on NMFS Alaska Regional Office (AKRO) data. 
The directed fishery has been closed since 2016/17 so fishery data in recent years are unavailable.

## Changes in Assessment Methodology {-}

This assessment uses the General model for Alasks crab stocks (Gmacs) framework. The
model is configured to track three stages of length categories and was 
first presented in May 2011 by Bill Gaeuman and accepted by the CPT in May 2012. 
A difference from the original approach, and that used here, is that natural and fishing mortality are
continuous within `r M[[ref_mod]]$nseason` discrete seasons (using the appropriate
catch equation rather than assuming an applied pulse removal). Season length in Gmacs
is controlled by changing the proportion of natural mortality that is applied
each season. 
Diagnostic output includes estimates of the "dynamic $B_0$" which simply
computes the ratio of the spawning biomass as estimated relative to the spawning biomass that would have occurred 
had there been no historical fishing mortality. 
Details of this implementation and other model details are provided in Appendix A.

## Changes in Assessment Results {-}

Both surveys indicate a decline over the past few years. The "reference" model is that which was selected for use in 2018.
There is only one new data set to be included this year so this becomes the updated reference model. 
One alternative models is presented for sensitivity, this configuration (named "Fit survey") simply adds emphasis on 
the design-based survey data (by assuming a lower input variance). 
Additionally, reference points calculated using a alternative time frame are presented here
(Table \@ref(tab:ofl-basis)) for consideration as a result of possible regimes present in the data.

# B. Responses to SSC and CPT  {-}

## CPT and SSC Comments on Assessments in General {-}
Not updated since 2018

Comment: *Regarding general code development, the SSC and CPT outstanding requests continue to be as follows:*

  1. *add the ability to conduct retrospective analyses*

     Progress was limited in implementing this feature.

  1. *add ability to estimate bycatch fishing mortality rates when observer data are missing but effort data is available*

     This was completed.

  1. *Continued exploration of data weighting (Francis and other approaches) and evaluation of models with and without the 
     1998 natural mortality spike. The authors are encouraged to bring other models forward for CPT and SSC consideration*

      We continued to include an alternative time series estimated from the NMFS trawl survey using the VAST spatiotemporal Delta GLMM model 
      and continued with the iterative re-weighting for composition data.

# C. Introduction {-}

## Scientific Name {-}

The blue king crab is a lithodid crab, *Paralithodes platypus* (Brant 1850).

## Distribution {-}

Blue king crab are sporadically distributed throughout the North Pacific Ocean from Hokkaido, Japan, to southeastern
Alaska (Figure \@ref(fig:distribution)).  In the eastern Bering Sea small populations are distributed around St. Matthew
Island, the Pribilof Islands, St. Lawrence Island, and Nunivak Island. Isolated populations also exist in some other
cold water areas of the Gulf of Alaska (NPFMC 1998). The St. Matthew Island Section for blue king crab is within Area Q2
(Figure \@ref(fig:registration)), which is the Northern District of the Bering Sea king crab registration area and
includes the waters north of Cape Newenham (58&deg;39' N. lat.) and south of Cape Romanzof (61&deg;49' N. lat.).
