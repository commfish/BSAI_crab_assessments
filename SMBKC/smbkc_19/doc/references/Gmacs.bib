	abstract = {A maximum likelihood method for modelling fish growth is presented that integrates data from three key sources of growth information: tagrecapture studies, lengthfrequency samples from commercial catches, and direct aging data from hard-parts analyses. Previous studies have almost exclusively modelled growth using only one of these sources of information. Different data sources are often most informative about different portions of the life cycle. The development of an integrated approach allows for the different data sources to complement each other and provide more comprehensive and robust estimates of growth parameters. The integrated method is applied to data sets from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) using the von Bertalanffy growth curve as well as a more sophisticated growth curve that makes a smooth transition between two von Bertalanffy curves with different growth rate parameters. The latter is found to provide a significantly better fit and supports previous findings that southern blu..., Nous présentons une méthode de vraisemblance maximale pour la modélisation de la croissance des poissons qui intègre les données provenant de trois sources importantes de renseignements sur la croissance, soit les études de marquagerecapture, les échantillons de longueursfréquences provenant des pêches commerciales et les données de détermination directe de l'âge par l'analyse des structures anatomiques dures. La plupart des études antérieures ont modélisé la croissance presque exclusivement à partir d'une seule de ces sources. Les sources différentes de données apportent souvent des informations sur des phases différentes du cycle biologique. La mise au point d'une approche intégrée permet aux différentes sources de renseignements de se compléter les unes les autres et de fournir des estimations plus complètes et plus robustes des paramètres de la croissance.

	title = {Revised input parameters and implications for the {Antarctic} toothfish (\textit{{Dissostichus} mawsoni}) stock assessment in {Subareas} 88.1 \& 88.2},
	volume = {07/6},
	abstract = {In this paper, we address a number of aspects of the model inputs and parameters of the Antarctic
toothfish stock assessment for the Ross Sea fishery. In particular we review catch history, lengthweight
relationships, catch-at-length and catch-at age. In addition, we report some preliminary model
runs that investigate the sensitivity of the 2006 stock assessment to changes in these model inputs and
parameters.
Tree-regression methods were used to investigate the areal structure of the length distribution of
Antarctic toothfish. While tree-regressions suggested strong evidence of a high degree of small-scale
areal complexity, we were unable to provide a stratification that resulted in improved or consistent
patterns in length frequencies over the duration of the fishery. Including terms for nation, vessel, or
vessel type did not provide any additional information as these tended to be highly correlated with the
location variables.
The catch and CPUE indices for the Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish fishery were updated, as are some
modelling parameters, and methods for calculating age- and length-frequencies. Most of these changes
did not have a significant impact on the assessment results.
We also provide an update of the numbers of fish scanned at length by New Zealand vessels, and the
numbers of tagged fish recaptured. Inclusion of observations of the 2006 fish recaptured in 2007 had
the greatest impact on the assessment model results. Dunn et al. (2007) noted that the locations of the
2007 recaptures were highly aggregated and were mostly located on four key locations in the Ross Sea,
and most had moved only short distances. This confirms the concern that the key uncertainty
underlying the current model is the impact of movements and spatial structure in the Antarctic
toothfish population. In particular, the level and nature of the bias from non-homogeneous mixing
assumptions of tagged fish.},

Chem. 248, 6122-6128) for isolating histidase-constitutive mutants of a non-N2-fixing bacterium. 2. Nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of NH4+ were as high as 100\% of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of NH4+. 3. Biochemical characterization of these nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals that they fall into three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29), requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively (in the presence of NH4+). A second class of mutants (strains SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, as determined immunologically. A third class of glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase. Since the mutant strains SK-27 and SK-37 produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein, it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene.},

Previous studies have almost exclusively modelled growth using only one of these sources of information. Different data sources are often most informative about different portions of the life cycle. The development of an integrated approach allows for the different data sources to complement each other and provide more comprehensive and robust estimates of growth parameters. The integrated method is applied to data sets from southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) using the von Bertalanffy growth curve as well as a more sophisticated growth curve that makes a smooth transition between two von Bertalanffy curves with different growth rate parameters. The latter is found to provide a significantly better fit and supports previous findings that southern blu..., Nous présentons une méthode de vraisemblance maximale pour la modélisation de la croissance des poissons qui intègre les données provenant de trois sources importantes de renseignements sur la croissance, soit les études de marquagerecapture, les échantillons de longueursfréquences provenant des pêches commerciales et les données de détermination directe de l'âge par l'analyse des structures anatomiques dures. La plupart des études antérieures ont modélisé la croissance presque exclusivement à partir d'une seule de ces sources. Les sources différentes de données apportent souvent des informations sur des phases différentes du cycle biologique. La mise au point d'une approche intégrée permet aux différentes sources de renseignements de se compléter les unes les autres et de fournir des estimations plus complètes et plus robustes des paramètres de la croissance.

	abstract = {The actions of glycine, GABA, alpha-alanine, beta-alanine and taurine were studied by intracellular recordings from lumbar motoneurons of the isolated spinal cord of the frog. All amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of membrane conductance. Furthermore, membrane polarizations occurred, which were always in the same direction as the IPSP. All these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids. When the relative strength of different amino acids was compared, taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency, followed by beta-alanine, alpha-alanine, GABA and glycine. Topically applied strychnine and picrotoxin induced different changes of post-synaptic potentials, indicating that distinct inhibitory systems might be influenced by these two convulsants. Interactions with amino acids showed that picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of GABA, while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine, glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. But differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected: the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. With regard to these results the importance of taurine and GABA as transmitters of postsynaptic inhibition on motoneurons in the spinal cord of the frog is discussed.},
