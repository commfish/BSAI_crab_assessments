# 2019 Executive Summary 
1. **Stock**: Blue king crab, *Paralithodes platypus*, Saint Matthew Island (SMBKC), Alaska.

2. **Catches**: Peak historical harvest was 4,288 t (9.454 million pounds) in 1983/84^[1983/84 refers to a fishing
year that extends from 1 July 1983 to 30 June 1984.]. The fishery was closed for 10 years after the stock was declared
overfished in 1999. Fishing resumed in 2009/10 with a fishery-reported retained catch of 209 t (0.461 million
pounds), less than half the 529.3 t (1.167 million pound) TAC. Following three more years of modest harvests
supported by a fishery catch per unit effort (CPUE) of around 10 crab per pot lift, the fishery was again closed in
2013/14 due to declining trawl-survey estimates of abundance and concerns about the health of the stock. 
The directed fishery resumed again in 2014/15 with a TAC of 300 t (0.655 million pounds), but the fishery performance was
relatively poor with a retained catch of 140 t (0.309 million pounds). 
The retained catch in 2015/16 was even lower at 48 t (0.105 million pounds) and the fishery has remained closed since 2016/17.

3. **Stock biomass**: The 1978-2018 NMFS trawl survey mean biomass is 5,605 t with the 2019 value being the
15th lowest (3,170 t; the tenth lowest since 2000). This 2019 biomass of $\ge$ 90 mm carapace length (CL) male crab is 
57% of the long term mean  at 6.99 million pounds (with a CV of 34%), and is a 83% increase from the 2018 mean biomass.
The most recent 3-year average of the NMFS survey is 40% of the mean value, indicating a decline in biomass compared to
historical survey estimates, notably in 2010 and 2011 that were over four times the current average. However, the 2019 value is substantially larger than the two previous years (3,170 t compared to 1,731 t in 2018 and 1,794 t in 2017).
The ADFG pot survey was did not take place in 2019, but in 2018 the relative biomass in this index was the lowest
in the time series (12% of the mean from the 11 surveys conducted since 1995).
The assessment model estimates tempers this increase and suggests that the stock (in survey biomass units) is presently at about
`r .get_cpue_df(Mbase) %>% filter(fleet==.FLEET[4]) %>% transmute(x = round(100*pred/mean(pred),0)) %>% tail(1) %>% .$x `% 
of the long term model-predicted survey biomass average. The trend from these values suggests a substantial increase, which does not fit the observed survey data points well.

4. **Recruitment**: Recruitment is based on estimated number of male crab within the 90-104 mm CL size class
in each year. The 2019 trawl-survey area-swept estimate of 0.403 million male SMBKC in this size class is the twelfth lowest in 
the 42 years since 1978 and follows two of the lowest previously observed values in 2017 and 2018. The recent six-year (2014 - 2019) average recruitment 
is only 47% of this mean. 
In the pot-survey, the abundance of this size group in 2017 was also the second-lowest in the time series (22% of the mean for the 
available pot-survey data) whereas in 2018 the value was the lowest observed at only 10% of the mean value.

5. **Management performance**: In this assessment estimated total male catch is the sum of fishery-reported retained
catch, estimated male discard mortality in the directed fishery, and estimated male bycatch mortality in the groundfish
fisheries.  Based on the reference model for SMBKC, the estimate for mature male biomass is below the minimum stock-size 
threshold (MSST) in 2017/18 and is hence is in an "overfished" condition, despite fishery closures in the last two years 
(and hence overfishing has not occurred) (Tables \ref{tab:status} and \ref{tab:status_pounds}). 
Computations which indicate the relative impact of fishing 
(i.e., the "dynamic $B_0$") suggests that the current spawning stock biomass has been reduced to 60%
<!--- `r #.get_dynB0_df(Mbase) %>% transmute(round(100*ssb,0)) %>% slice(n())`%  -->
 of what it would have been in the absence of
fishing, assuming the same level of recruitment as estimated.

# A. Summary of Major Changes

## Changes in Management of the Fishery

There are no new changes in management of the fishery.

## Changes to the Input Data

Data used in this assessment have been updated to include the most recently
available fishery and survey numbers. This assessment makes use of one new
survey data point - the 2019 NMFS trawl-survey estimate of abudance but no ADF&G pot survey was conducted in 2019. THe NMFS trawl-surveys has associated size
compositon data. The assessment also uses updated 2010-2018 groundfish and
fixed gear bycatch estimates based on NMFS Alaska Regional Office (AKRO) data. 
The directed fishery has been closed since 2016/17 so fishery data in recent years are unavailable.

## Changes in Assessment Methodology

This assessment uses the General model for Alasks crab stocks (Gmacs) framework. The
model is configured to track three stages of length categories and was 
first presented in May 2011 by Bill Gaeuman and accepted by the CPT in May 2012. 
A difference from the original approach, and that used here, is that natural and fishing mortality are
continuous within `r M[[1]]$nseason` discrete seasons (using the appropriate
catch equation rather than assuming an applied pulse removal). Season length in Gmacs
is controlled by changing the proportion of natural mortality that is applied
each season. 
Details of this implementation and other model details are provided in Appendix A (re-order appendices).

## Changes in Assessment Results

Both surveys indicate a decline over the past few years. The "reference" model is that which was selected for use in 2018.  There is only one new data set to be included this year so this becomes the updated reference model. 
Two alternative models are presented for
sensitivity. One involves a re-analysis of the NMFS trawl survey data using a spatio-temporal Delta-GLMM approach (VAST
model; Thorson and Barnett 2017) and the other configuration (named "Fit survey") simply adds emphasis on 
the design-based survey data
(by assuming a lower input variance). The VAST model suggests a XXX from the 2018 survey estimate. However,
 the model tends to moderate the noise in the survey observations and declines.
 
# B. Responses to SSC and CPT Comments

## CPT and SSC Comments on Assessments in General
Not updated since 2018

Comment: *Regarding general code development, the SSC and CPT outstanding requests continue to be as follows:*

  1. *add the ability to conduct retrospective analyses*

     Progress was limited in implementing this feature.

  1. *add ability to estimate bycatch fishing mortality rates when observer data are missing but effort data is available*

     This was completed.

  1. *Continued exploration of data weighting (Francis and other approaches) and evaluation of models with and without the 
     1998 natural mortality spike. The authors are encouraged to bring other models forward for CPT and SSC consideration*

      We continued to include an alternative time series estimated from the NMFS trawl survey using the VAST spatiotemporal Delta GLMM model 
      and continued with the iterative re-weighting for composition data.

# C. Introduction

## Scientific Name

The blue king crab is a lithodid crab, *Paralithodes platypus* (Brant 1850).

## Distribution

Blue king crab are sporadically distributed throughout the North Pacific Ocean from Hokkaido, Japan, to southeastern
Alaska (Figure ).  In the eastern Bering Sea small populations are distributed around St. Matthew
Island, the Pribilof Islands, St. Lawrence Island, and Nunivak Island. Isolated populations also exist in some other
cold water areas of the Gulf of Alaska (NPFMC 1998). The St. Matthew Island Section for blue king crab is within Area Q2
(Figure ), which is the Northern District of the Bering Sea king crab registration area and
includes the waters north of Cape Newenham (58&deg;39' N. lat.) and south of Cape Romanzof (61&deg;49' N. lat.).

## Stock Structure

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) Gene Conservation Laboratory, has detected regional population
differences between blue king crab collected from St. Matthew Island and the Pribilof Islands^[NOAA grant Bering Sea
Crab Research II, NA16FN2621, 1997.]. NMFS tag-return data from studies on blue king crab in the Pribilof Islands and
St. Matthew Island support the idea that legal-sized males do not migrate between the two areas (Otto and Cummiskey
1990). St. Matthew Island blue king crab tend to be smaller than their Pribilof conspecifics, and the two stocks are
managed separately.

## Life History

Like the red king crab, *Paralithodes camtshaticus*, the blue king crab is considered a shallow water species by
comparison with other lithodids such as golden king crab, *Lithodes aequispinus*, and the scarlet king crab, 
*Lithodes couesi* (Donaldson and Byersdorfer 2005). Adult male blue king crab are found at an average depth of 70 m (NPFMC 1998).
The reproductive cycle appears to be annual for the first two reproductive cycles and biennial thereafter (Jensen
and Armstrong 1989), and mature crab seasonally migrate inshore where they molt and mate. Unlike red king crab, juvenile
blue king crab do not form pods, but instead rely on cryptic coloration for protection from predators and require
suitable habitat such as cobble and shell hash. Somerton and MacIntosh (1983) estimated SMBKC male size at sexual
maturity to be 77 mm carapace length (CL). Paul et al. (1991) found that spermatophores were present in the vas deferens
of 50% of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab males examined with sizes of 40-49 mm CL and in 100% of the males at
least 100 mm CL. Spermataphore diameter also increased with increasing CL with an asymptote at ~ 100 mm CL. It was noted,
however, that although spermataphore presence indicates physiological sexual maturity, it may not be an indicator of
functional sexual maturity. For purposes of management of the St. Matthew Island blue king crab fishery, the State of
Alaska uses 105 mm CL to define the lower size bound of functionally mature males (Pengilly and Schmidt 1995). Otto and
Cummiskey (1990) report an average growth increment of 14.1 mm CL for adult SMBKC males.

## Major Data Sources




## Other Data Sources

The growth transition matrix used is based on Otto and Cummiskey (1990), as in the past. Other relevant data sources,
including assumed population and fishery parameters, are presented in Appendix A, which also provides a detailed
description of the model configuration used for this assessment.

# E. Analytic Approach

## History of Modeling Approaches for this Stock

A four-stage catch-survey-analysis (CSA) assessment model was used before 2011 to estimate abundance and biomass and
prescribe fishery quotas for the SMBKC stock. The four-stage CSA is similar to a full
length-based analysis, the major difference being coarser length groups, which are more suited to a small stock with
consistently low survey catches. In this approach, the abundance of male crab with a CL $\ge$ 90 mm is modeled in
terms of four crab stages: stage 1: 90-104 mm CL; stage 2: 105-119 mm CL; stage 3: newshell 120-133 mm CL; and stage 4:
oldshell $\ge$ 120 mm CL and newshell $\ge$ 134 mm CL. Motivation for these stage definitions comes from the fact that
for management of the SMBKC stock, male crab measuring $\ge$ 105 mm CL are considered mature, whereas 120 mm CL is
considered a proxy for the legal size of 5.5 in carapace width, including spines. Additional motivation for these stage
definitions comes from an estimated average growth increment of about 14 mm per molt for SMBKC (Otto and Cummiskey
1990).

Concerns about the pre-2011 assessment model led to the CPT and SSC recommendations that included development of an
alternative model with provisional assessment based on survey biomass or some other index of abundance. An alternative
3-stage model was proposed to the CPT in May 2011, but a survey-based approach was requested for the Fall
2011 assessment. In May 2012 the CPT approved a slightly revised and better documented version of the alternative model
for assessment. Subsequently, the model developed and used since  2012 was a variant of the previous four-stage SMBKC
CSA model and similar in complexity to that described by Collie et al. (2005). Like the earlier model, it considered
only male crab $\ge$ 90 mm in CL, but combined stages 3 and 4 of the earlier model, resulting in three stages
(male size classes) defined by CL measurements of (1) 90-104 mm, (2) 105-119 mm, and (3) 120 mm+ (i.e., 120 mm and
above). This consolidation was driven by concern about the accuracy and consistency of shell-condition information,
which had been used in distinguishing stages 3 and 4 of the earlier model.

In 2016 the accepted SMBKC assessment model made use of the modeling framework Gmacs (Webber et al. 2016). In that
assessment,  an effort was made to match the 2015 SMBKC stock assessment model to bridge a framework which 
provided greater flexibility and opportunity to evaluate model assumptions more fully.

## Assessment Methodology

This assessment model again uses the modeling framework Gmacs and is detailed in Appendix A.

## Model Selection and Evaluation

Five models were presented in the previous assessment. This year, four models are presented with the  reference model
being the same configuration as approved last year (Ianelli et al. 2017), two sensitivities are considered, one with a  different treatment of NMFS
bottom trawl survey (BTS) data using a geo-spatial model (VAST; Thorson and Barnett 2017; Appendix C). A second 
sensitivity was constructed which weights the
survey data more heavily. In addition to these sensitivities, we evaluated the impacts of adding new data 
to the reference model. In summary, the following lists the models presented and the naming convention  used:

1. **2017 Model**: the 2017 recommended model without any new data

2. **BTS**: adds in the 2018 bottom trawl survey (BTS) data

3. **BTS and pot**: as with previous but including the 2018 ADFG pot survey data (Model 16.0 or "reference case")

3. **VAST**: applies a geo-spatial delta-GLMM model (Thorson and Barnett 2017) to the BTS data which provides a different BTS index. See appendix B for 
  details and diagnostics. This is a preliminary examination as more work is needed to ensure options for the BTS CPUE data
   were specified appropriately.

3. **Fit survey**: an exploratory scenario that's the same as the reference model except the NMFS trawl survey is up-weighted by


Note that SSC convention would label these (item 3 above) as model 16.0 (the
model first developed in that year). Since only a few models are presented here, for simplicity
we labeled model 16.0 as "reference" and for the others, we used the  simple naming convention
presented above.

## Results


# G. Rebuilding Analysis

This stock is not currently subject to a rebuilding plan. However, interpretation of the point estimate for the reference case
suggests that the mature male biomass is below 50% of $B_\mathit{MSY}$ but 

# H. Data Gaps and Research Priorities

The following topics have been listed as areas where more research on SMBKC is needed:

  1. Growth increments and molting probabilities as a function of size.

  2. Trawl survey catchability and selectivities.

  3. Temporal changes in spatial distributions near the island.

  4. Natural mortality.

# I. Projections and outlook

The outlook for recruitment is pessimistic and the abundance relative to the proxy $B_\mathit{MSY}$ is low. 
The NMFS survey results in 2018 noted ocean conditions warmer than 
normal with an absence of a "cold pool" in the region. This could have detrimental effects on the SMBKC stocks and
should be carefully monitored. Relative to the impact of historical fishing, we again conducted a
 "dynamic-$B_0$" analysis. This procedure simply projects
the population based on estimated recruitment but removes the effect of fishing.
